2.2        Chromosome Number and Morphology

2.2.1      Non-Banding Techniques

           In the construction of the karyogram1 the autosomes are numbered from 1 to 22 in order of decreas-
           ing length (for historical reasons chromosome 21 is listed before chromosome 22, despite it being
           smaller). The sex chromosomes are referred to as X and Y.
               When chromosomes are stained by methods that do not produce bands, they can be arranged
           into seven readily distinguishable groups, defined as A to G, based on descending order of size, and
           the ratio of the length of the short arm to the long arm with respect to the centromere (London Con-
           ference, 1963). Satellites are not always visible on all chromosomes in the D and G groups as the
           number and size of these structures are variable. The following parameters were used to describe
           non-banded chromosomes:
           • The length of each chromosome, expressed as a percentage of the total length of a normal hap-
               loid set, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the 22 autosomes and of the X chromosome;
           • The arm ratio of the chromosomes, expressed as the length of the longer arm relative to the
               shorter arm; and
           • The centromeric index, expressed as the ratio of the length of the shorter arm to the whole length
               of the chromosome. The latter two indices are, of course, related algebraically.

               Group A (1–3)       Large metacentric chromosomes distinguished from each other by size
                                   and centromere position
               Group B (4–5)       Large submetacentric chromosomes
               Group C (6–12, X) Medium-sized metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes. The X
                                   chromosome resembles the longer chromosomes in this group
               Group D (13–15) Medium-sized acrocentric chromosomes with satellites
               Group E (16–18) Relatively short metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes
               Group F (19–20) Short metacentric chromosomes
               Group G (21–22, Y) Short acrocentric chromosomes with satellites. The Y chromosome has no
                                   satellites
           The definition of metacentric, submetacentric, and acrocentric traditionally relates to the ratio of the
           chromosome arms in unbanded preparations (Levan et al., 1964; Al-Aish, 1969).


2.2.2      Banding Techniques

           Numerous technical procedures have been reported that produce banding patterns on metaphase
           chromosomes. The chromosomes are visualized as consisting of a continuous series of light and dark
           bands, so that, by definition, there are no “interbands.” Bands that stain darkly with one method may
           stain lightly with other methods. The methods first published for demonstrating bands along the
           chromosomes are:
           • Q-bands (Fig. 1): Caspersson et al. (1972)
           • G-bands (Fig. 2): Seabright (1971)
           • R-bands (Fig. 3): Dutrillaux and Lejeune (1971)

           1  The terms karyogram, karyotype, and idiogram have often been used indiscriminately. The term karyogram should
           be applied to a systematized array of the chromosomes prepared either by drawing, digitized imaging, or by photogra-
           phy, with the extension in meaning that the chromosomes of a single cell can typify the chromosomes of an individual
           or even a species. The term karyotype should be used to describe the normal or abnormal, constitutional or acquired,
           chromosomal complement of an individual, tissue or cell line. We recommend that the term idiogram be reserved for the
           diagrammatic representation of a karyotype.

    The banding techniques fall into two principal groups:
    1. Those resulting in bands distributed along the length of the whole chromosome, such as G-, Q-,
         and R-bands, including techniques that demonstrate patterns of DNA replication, and
    2. Those that stain specific chromosomal structures and hence give rise to a restricted number of
         bands (Table 1). These include methods that reveal constitutive heterochromatin (C-bands)
         (Fig. 4), telomeric bands (T-bands), and nucleolus organizing regions (NORs). For the banding
         technique acronyms, refer to Table 2.
         The patterns obtained with the various C-banding methods do not permit identification of every
    chromosome in the somatic cell complement but can be used to identify specific chromosomes
    (Table 1). The C-bands on chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and Y are morphologically variable. The short-
    arm regions of the acrocentric chromosomes also demonstrate variations in size and staining inten-
    sity of the Q-, G-, R-, C-, T- bands and NOR staining. These variations are heritable benign features
    of the particular chromosome.

2.2.3       X- and Y-Chromatin

            Inactive X chromosomes, as well as the heterochromatic segment on the long arm of the Y chromo-
            some, appear as distinctive structures in interphase nuclei, for which the terms X-chromatin (Barr
            body, sex chromatin, X-body) and Y-chromatin (Y-body), respectively, should be used.


2.3         Chromosome Band Nomenclature

2.3.1       Identification and Definition of Chromosome Bands, Landmarks and Regions

            Bands are defined as parts of a chromosome that are clearly distinguishable from their adjacent seg-
            ments by appearing darker or lighter with one or more banding techniques. The bands are large
            structures of differing size, that may include hundreds of genes.
            Landmarks are defined as consistent and distinct morphologic features important in identifying the
            chromosome. Landmarks include the ends of the chromosome arms, the centromere, and certain
            bands. (See Table 12 in Appendix)
            Regions are defined as an area of a chromosome lying between two adjacent landmarks.


        Normal Chromosomes                          Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224              7
                                                    DOI: 10.1159/000538512
        Fig. 3. R-banded human karyogram (courtesy of Dr. M. Prieur).




            The bands are allocated to various regions along the chromosome arms, and the regions are delim-
            ited by specific landmarks. The bands and the regions are numbered consecutively from the centro-
            mere outward along each chromosome arm.


2.3.2       Designation of Regions, Bands and Subbands

        a. The symbols p and q are used to designate, respectively, the short and long arms of each chromo-
           some.
        b. The centromere (cen) itself is designated 10; the part facing the short arm is p10, the part facing
           the long arm is q10 (not shown in the idiograms in the Appendix). The two regions adjacent to the
           centromere are labeled as 1 in each arm; the next, more distal regions as 2, and so on. The hetero-
           chromatic regions adjacent to the centromere carry band designations of 11, 11.1 or 11.11 depend-
           ing on the level of resolution. A band used as a landmark is considered as belonging entirely to the
           region distal to the landmark and is accorded the band number of 1 in that region.
        c. In designating a particular band, four items are required:
           • The chromosome number
           • The arm symbol

           • The region number, and
           • The band number within that region
           • These items are given in order without spacing or punctuation. For example, 1p31 indicates
             chromosome 1, short arm, region 3, band 1.
      d. Whenever an existing band is subdivided, a decimal point (.) is placed after the original band des-
         ignation and is followed by the number assigned to each subband.
      e. The subbands are numbered sequentially from the centromere outward. For example, if the original
         band 1p31 is subdivided into three equal or unequal subbands, the subbands are labeled 1p31.1,
         1p31.2, and 1p31.3, subband 1p31.1 being proximal and 1p31.3 distal to the centromere.
      f. If a subband is subdivided, additional digits, but no further punctuation, are used; e.g., subband
         1p31.1 might be further subdivided into 1p31.11, 1p31.12, etc. In principle a band can be subdi-
         vided into any number of new bands at higher resolution.


2.4        High-Resolution Banding

           The nomenclature for high-resolution preparations of prophase and prometaphase chromosomes
           described in ISCN 1981 is an extension of the nomenclature for the banding patterns for metaphase
           chromosomes established at the Paris Conference (1971) and in ISCN 1978.

                       DOI: 10.1159/000538512
               High-resolution banding techniques can be applied to chromosomes in different stages of the
           cell cycle, e.g., prophase, prometaphase, or interphase (by methods that induce premature chromo-
           some condensation). Furthermore, the number of discernible bands depends not only on the state of
           condensation but also on the banding technique used. The level of resolution is determined by the
           number of bands seen in a haploid set (22 autosomes plus either X or Y). The standard idiograms
           provide schematic representations of chromosomes corresponding to approximately 300, 400, 550,
           700 and 850 bands per haploid set (bphs) (see Chia, 2009; Francke, 1981, 1994 and Fig. 15 in the
           Appendix). These resolution labels are not intended to convey the actual number of bands, for ex-
           ample the 700 bphs is actually 759 bphs in males and 786 bphs in females (Chia, 2009; Thomas
           Liehr, personal communication). Although larger numbers of bands can be visualized, designating
           the idiograms as 550 to 850 bands is sufficient for practical purposes.
               The idiograms were designed differently for the applications of ISCN and Genome Browsers
           resulting in some discrepancies. The 700-band level is the best fit to the GRCh38 idiograms. How-
           ever, two loci are more detailed in GRCh38 than in the ISCN: 6p24 and 9q34.1. On the other hand,
           the ISCN 850-band level is more detailed than GRCh38 idiograms at five loci: 1q32, 2p21, 5q13.2,
           6p22.3 and 6q21.
               In G-banded preparations, new subbands appear to arise by subdivision of darkly stained G-
           bands on less extended chromosomes, while in R-staining preparations the dark R-bands appear to
           split. Therefore, in assigning subband numbers, arbitrary decisions were made for the purposes of
           nomenclature only and they should not be interpreted as statements about chromosome physiology.
           Examples of G- and R-banded chromosomes at successive stages of resolution are shown in the
           Appendix (see Fig. 16a, b). In addition, G- and R-banded metaphase chromosomes at approximate-
           ly the 550-band level and their diagrammatic representation are illustrated in a detachable foldout
           on the inside of the back cover.


2.5        Variation in Heterochromatic Segments, Satellite Stalks and Satellites

           Variation refers to the differences in size or staining of chromosomal segments in the population
           (see Wyandt and Tonk, 2008, and Table 1). The following sections outline a means to describe these
           variations; however, to avoid misinterpretation, these benign variants are not included in ISCN de-
           scriptions. Rather, they should be reserved for report text descriptions in which the variation may
           be useful to distinguish between two or more distinct cell lines or clones, e.g., chimerism or trans-
           plant. Note: it is essential that a balanced or unbalanced rearrangement involving the satellites is
           excluded before assuming this is a benign variant (described in Sections 2.2.2, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2).


2.5.1      Variation in Length

           Variation in length of heterochromatic segments (h), stalks (stk) or satellites (s) should be distin-
           guished from increases or decreases in arm length as a result of other structural alterations by plac-
           ing a plus (+) or minus (–) sign after the symbols h, stk or s following the appropriate chromosome
           and arm designation.

2.5.2        Variation in Number and Position

             The same nomenclature symbols as described above are used to describe variation in position of
             heterochromatic segments, satellite stalks, and satellites and should not be included in the ISCN but
             can be described in the text of the report.

                1q41h                      Heterochromatic segment in chromosome 1 at band 1q41

             Duplicated chromosome structures are indicated by repeating the appropriate designation:

                21pss                      Double satellites on the short arm of chromosome 21
                14pstkstk                  Double stalks on the short arm of chromosome 14

             Likewise, the common population inversion variants (see Table 1) are specified by their euchro-
             matic breakpoints and should not be reported in the ISCN.

                inv(9)(p12q13)        Pericentric inversion on chromosome 9
                inv(2)(p11.2q13)      Pericentric inversion on chromosome 2
                inv(Y)(p11.2q11.2)pat Pericentric inversion on the Y chromosome inherited from the father


2.6          Euchromatic Variants

             There are several euchromatic duplications and deletions involving both G-positive and G-negative
             bands that are phenotypically neutral (see Wyandt and Tonk, 2008; Behrend et al., 2023). The most
             common euchromatic variants occur at 4p16, 8p23.1, 9p12, 9q12, 9q13, 15q11.2 and 16p11.2, but
             these must be distinguished from the clinically significant (likely pathogenic/pathogenic) variants
             such as dup(8)(p23.1p23.1) and del(15)(q11.2q11.2). Only clinically significant (likely pathogenic/
             pathogenic) euchromatic variants should be reported in the ISCN.

2.6.1      Copy Number Variants and Structural Variants

           Benign and likely benign copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) are NOT re-
           ported in the ISCN. However, if the CNV or SV is suggestive of a structural rearrangement(s) at a
           chromosome level, then these should be reported, as there may be reproductive implications. Follow-
           up studies may be required.
               Laboratories should report clinically significant variants in the ISCN according to the labora-
           tory policy and current guidelines.


2.6.2      Fragile Sites

           Fragile sites (fra) associated with a specific disease or phenotype are referred to in Section 5.5.7.
               Fragile sites associated with specific chromosome bands can occur as normal variants with no
           phenotypic consequences. These fragile sites are inherited in a co-dominant Mendelian fashion and
           may result in chromosome abnormalities such as deletions, multiradial figures, and acentric frag-
           ments. While there may be several different types of fragile sites inducible by culturing cells in me-
           dia containing different components, all of these will be covered by a single nomenclature.

               fra(10)(q25.2)                        A fragile site on chromosome 10 in 10q25.2
               fra(10)(q22.1),fra(10)(q25.2)         Two fragile sites on chromosome 10
               fra(10)(q22.1),fra(10)(q25.2)         Two fragile sites on different homologues
               fra(10)(q25.2),fra(16)(q22.1)         Two fragile sites on different chromosomes

4.1              Introduction

            a. ISCN provides a unified nomenclature to describe the chromosome complement and aberrations. This
               nomenclature is improved regularly for existing technologies and expanded as new technological ap-
               proaches are developed. Over time, redundancies and inconsistencies between chapters have appeared,


            18                 Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224    ISCN 2024
                               DOI: 10.1159/000538512
         whilst rules have been dispersed throughout different chapters in the ISCN. ISCN 2024 provides an
         overview of the general rules applying to all technologies in Chapter 4. Terms and recommendations
         related to specific technologies and applications are described in detail in the relevant chapters.
      b. Some of the examples in this and subsequent chapters do not represent observed abnormalities but
         are provided to demonstrate the nomenclature principles.


4.2       General Principles

      a. The current version of ISCN must always be used. As ISCN guidelines may differ between versions,
         it is recommended that either the interpretive text or the test details of the report include a statement
         on the version of ISCN used to write the nomenclature description. This is particularly relevant for
         follow-up samples.
      b. A summary of the general principles applicable to cytogenomic reporting of the various method-
         ologies is given in Table 3.

          Table 3. The following general principles are applicable to multiple chapters and techniques as indicated.

                                                                             Karyotype Neoplasia ish   arr    ogm rsa      seq

        c. The same general rules for designating chromosome aberrations are followed in the description of
           constitutional and neoplastic chromosome aberrations.
        d. Abnormal findings and/or clinically significant results, based upon the laboratory’s reporting pro-
           tocols, must be included in the ISCN. Additionally, normal sex chromosomes may be reported for
           the purpose of:
           • clarity of the sex complement is required (see Sections 8.2.2, 8.2.3, 11.4.2.1);
           • chimerism (Sections 4.5.3, 8.2.6);
           • when part of a targeted assay (see Chapter 10).
        e. Abnormal results are reported using two different formats, karyotype format and microarray format
           (see Section 4.7). The karyotype format is described using either the abbreviated, short, and detailed
           systems, while the microarray format is expressed using either the abbreviated, short, and extended
           systems (see Section 4.7).


4.2.1        Chromosome Abnormality Description Rules

        a. The number of chromosomes is specified first, followed by a comma (,), the sex chromosome com-
           plement, followed by a comma and then the chromosome abnormality. There are no spaces before
           or after a comma (see Section 4.4.1).
        b. If a sex chromosome has a structural abnormality, the normal chromosome, if present, is listed first.
        c. The total number of analyzed metaphases is not specified in constitutional samples, unless there is evidence
           of clinically significant mosaicism. The number of metaphases must always be given in the karyotype of
           neoplastic samples, even when the result is normal, or the abnormality is present in all metaphases.
        d. Absolute cell numbers are given in square brackets ([ ]).
        e. For neoplastic samples, constitutional chromosome anomalies are indicated by the letter c immedi-
           ately after the constitutional abnormality designation (see also Sections 5.1 and 6.4). When associ-
           ated with the sex chromosomes, the letter c refers to the whole sex complement (see Section 5.3.1.2).
             i.    48,XX,+8,+21c[20]
                   Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with acquired trisomy 8 in a female individual with constitutional trisomy 21.


             ii.   46,XXYc,–X[10]/47,XXYc[2]
                   Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with acquired loss of one X chromosome in ten metaphases in an individual with
                   Klinefelter syndrome.

        f. For clarity, rearrangements are written with breakpoints the first time they are listed in the ISCN
           description. It is not necessary to repeat the breakpoints subsequently e.g.,
                constitutional: 47,XXX,t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)[10]/46,XX,t(11;22)[10]
                neoplasia: 46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[10]/47,XX,t(9;22),+der(22)[10]
        g. Inherited (inh) aberrations for which the parental origin has not been established or disclosed may
           be indicated as 46,XX,t(5;6)(q34;q23)inh
           • When it is known from which parent the aberration is inherited, the abbreviation for maternal
                (mat) or paternal (pat) is used immediately following the designation of the abnormality, e.g.,
                46,XX,t(5;6)(q34;q23)mat,inv(14)(q12q31)pat
           • If only part of an aberration (e.g., one derivative chromosome from a parental balanced translo-
                cation) has been inherited, the abbreviation dmat, dpat or dinh is used to distinguish it from the
                complement in the parent, e.g., 46,XX,der(5)t(5;6)(q34;q23)dmat,inv(14)(q12q31)pat
        h. If it is known that the parents’ chromosomes are normal with respect to the abnormality, the abnor-
           mality may be designated de novo (dn), e.g., 46,XY,t(5;6)(q34;q23)mat,inv(14)(q12q31)dn
        i. Alternative interpretations of an aberration are provided with the term or.
           Note: there is a space before and after the term or (see Section 4.4.1).

                                DOI: 10.1159/000538512
     i.    46,XX,add(19)(p13.3 or q13.3)
           A female karyotype shows additional material of unknown origin attached to either 19p13.3 or 19q13.3 (see Sec-
           tion 5.5.1).

     ii.   46,Y,del(X)(q22) or i(X)(p10)
           A male karyotype shows a deletion of the long arm of the X chromosome with a breakpoint in Xq22 or an isochro-
           mosome of the short arm of the X chromosome. Note: the different structural rearrangements give rise to karyo-
           typically similar abnormal X chromosomes.

     iii. 46,XX,t(12;14)(q15;q24) or t(12;14)(q13;q22)
           The two alternative interpretations of the t(12;14) give rise to karyotypically similar chromosomes in this female
           karyotype. Note: the breakpoints are in either of these two ISCN descriptions, which is a different situation to
           t(12;14)(q13∼15;q22∼24), where the breakpoint localizations are less certain and a variety of breakpoint combina-
           tions are possible (see example iv in j below).

j.   When there is uncertainty over the breakpoint localization or chromosome number, a tilde (~) is
     used to denote intervals and to express uncertainty about breakpoint localizations and/or the range
     of chromosome numbers.
     i.    45∼48,XX,+8[cp10]
           The chromosome number is within the interval 45 to 48 in this female karyotype of a neoplastic sample where the
           only clonal abnormality identified is trisomy 8.

     ii.   46,XX,del(1)(q21∼24)
           A female karyotype shows an apparently terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 1 and a breakpoint
           within the segment 1q21 to 1q24, i.e., the breakpoint may be in band 1q21, 1q22, 1q23 or 1q24.

     iii. 46,XY,dup(1)(p34∼32p22)
           A male karyotype shows duplication in the short arm of chromosome 1; the distal breakpoint is in 1p34, 1p33 or
           1p32 and the proximal breakpoint is in band 1p22.

     iv. 46,XX,t(3;12)(q27∼29;q13∼15)
           A female karyotype where both breakpoints in this translocation are uncertain; in chromosome 3 the breakpoint
           may be in bands 3q27, 3q28 or 3q29 and in chromosome 12 in bands 12q13, 12q14 or 12q15.

     v.    ogm[GRCh38] t(6;7)(q21;q32.1)(108,976,886∼108,982,237;128,310,022∼128,316,239)
           Genome mapping identified a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 6 and 7. The chromosomes and break-
           points are separated by a semicolon (;) as are the nucleotides. Note: this nomenclature uses the short system (karyo-
           type format) (see Section 4.7) and the tilde (~) demonstrates the region of uncertainty in the breakpoints at the
           nucleotide level.

k. A question mark (?) indicates uncertain identification of a chromosome or chromosome structure.
   It is placed either before the uncertain item, or it may replace a chromosome, region, band or sub-
   band designation.
     i.    45,XX,–?21
           A female karyotype with a missing chromosome, likely to be chromosome 21.

     ii.   47,XX,+?8
           A female karyotype with an additional chromosome, likely to be chromosome 8.

     iii. 46,XY,?del(1)(p36.1)
           A male karyotype where the deletion is uncertain, but if present it is a terminal deletion from chromosome 1, band
           p36.1 to 1pter.

     iv. 46,XX,del(19)(?q)
           A female karyotype where there is a deletion, likely to be in the long arm of chromosome 19.

     v.    46,XX,del(20)(q?)
           A female karyotype with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 20, but neither the region nor the band can be
           identified.

           vi. 46,XX,del(1)(q?2)
                 A female karyotype with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 1, probably in region 1q2.

           vii. 46,XY,del(1)(q?23)
                 A male karyotype where it is uncertain whether the breakpoint in the long arm of chromosome 1 is in region 1q2.
                 If so, the breakpoint is in band 1q23.

           viii. 46,XX,del(1)(q2?)
                 A female karyotype with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 1 in region 1q2, and it is not possible to deter-
                 mine the band within that region.

           ix. 46,XY,del(1)(q2?3)
                 A male karyotype with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 1 in region 1q2, probably in band 1q23.

           x.    46,XY,t(5;6)(q31.1;q22.?1)
                 A male karyotype with a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 6. The breakpoint in chromosome 5 is within
                 5q31.1 and the breakpoint in the long arm of chromosome 6 is in the region of 6q22 and probably in subband 6q22.1
                 but this is uncertain.

           xi. 46,XX,der(1)?t(1;3)(p22;q13)
                 A female karyotype where the der(1) has probably resulted from a t(1;3) with proposed breakpoints in bands 1p22
                 and 3q13.

           xii. 46,XY,der(5)ins(5;?)(q32;?)
                 A male karyotype with a derivative chromosome from an insertion of unidentified chromosomal material into the
                 long arm of chromosome 5 at band 5q32.

           xiii. 46,XY,–5,+der(?)t(?;5)(?;q13)
                 A male karyotype with loss of a chromosome 5 and gain of a derivative chromosome of an unknown origin that is
                 composed partly of chromosome 5 long arm material. Note: the unknown chromosome (?) contains the centromere
                 and so is listed before chromosome 5 in the description of the translocation.

           xiv. 46,XX.ish X(DXZ1×2),der(7)ins(7;Y)(q3?;p11.?2p11.?2)(SRY+)
                 In situ hybridization using probes for the X chromosome pericentromeric alphoid repeat sequence and the SRY gene
                 shows a signal for the SRY probe in region 7q3 of one chromosome 7, and the band cannot be determined. The
                 breakpoints of the inserted Y chromosome segment are uncertain but are possibly in Yp11.2, which contains the
                 SRY gene. The DXZ1 signal pattern is given as this is an XX male.



4.3        Order of Cytogenomic Abnormalities

      a. For karyotype, the normal sex chromosomes are listed before any abnormality. When there is an
         abnormal X chromosome in a male individual, the normal Y chromosome is listed first. When clar-
         ity of the sex complement is required, the normal Y chromosome may be listed in microarray and
         genome mapping, and it appears in the ISCN description before the abnormal X chromosome (see
         example ii).
           i.    46,Y,t(X;10)(q27;p13)
                 A male constitutional karyotype. The normal Y chromosome is listed before the translocation involving the X chro-
                 mosome.

           ii.   ogm[GRCh38] (Y)×1,Xq25(126023321×1,126228413_126535347×0,126556900×1)mat
                 Genome mapping shows with an interstitial deletion of Xq25 involving loss of nucleotides between 126,228,413
                 and 126,535,347 of maternal origin in a male. The normal Y chromosome is described so the sex chromosome con-
                 stitution is clear, i.e., the individual is male and not a female with a single X chromosome. Note: to avoid confusion,
                 commas to separate millions and thousands are not used in the nucleotides in the extended system (microarray for-
                 mat) (see Section 4.7).

b. Sex chromosome aberrations are specified first. (X chromosome abnormalities are presented before
   those involving the Y chromosome), followed by abnormalities of the autosomes listed in numerical
   order irrespective of the aberration type. Each abnormality is separated by a comma (,).
   i.    50,X,+X,−Y,+10,+14,+17,+21[5]
         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample in a male. The numerical abnormality of the X chromosome is listed before that

         A female karyotype shows a reciprocal translocation between the X chromosome at Xq27 and chromosome 13 at
         13q12, an inversion of chromosome 10 between 10p13 and 10q22 and trisomy 21. The sex chromosome abnormal-
         ity is presented first, followed by the autosomal abnormalities in chromosome number order, irrespective of wheth-
         er the aberrations are numerical or structural.

   iii. 47,Y,t(X;13)(q27;q12),inv(10)(p13q22),+21
         The same karyotype as in the previous example in a male. The normal Y chromosome is listed before the abnormal
         X chromosome.

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample in a male. The abnormality involving the X chromosome is listed before that of
         the Y chromosome.

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample in a male. The translocation involving the Y chromosome is presented first, fol-
         lowed by all autosomal abnormalities in consecutive chromosome number order.

   vi. arr[GRCh38] Xp22.33(23,934_1,604,049)×3,9p24.3p23(56,537_9,401,480)×1

         chromosome 9 at 9p24.3 to 9p23. The abnormalities are given in chromosome order.

c. For each homologous chromosome, numerical abnormalities are listed before structural changes and
   constitutional abnormalities are listed before the same acquired abnormality.
   i.    46,XY,+13,der(13;14)(q10;q10)
         A male karyotype in which the abnormalities are presented in chromosome order (13 before 14) with the chromo-

         some 3, an inversion 3, monosomy 7, trisomy 10, monosomy 20, an interstitial deletion within the long arm of
         chromosome 20, and trisomy 21. The normal X chromosome is listed first followed by the abnormal X chromosome
         with an inversion. The extra chromosome 3 is presented before the inversion of chromosome 3, and the monosomy
         20 before the deletion of chromosome 20. Note: the karyotype can also be written to show gain of the inverted
         chromosome 3, and therefore trisomy is implied, i.e.,
         47,X,inv(X)(p21q26),+inv(3)(q21q26.2),–7,+10,–20,del(20)(q11.2q13.1),+21[10]

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample in a XXY male shows an acquired gain of an X chromosome and acquired gain
         of chromosome 21, both are listed after the respective constitutional gain.
d. Multiple structural changes of homologous chromosomes are presented in alphabetical order ac-
   cording to the abbreviated term of the abnormality.
   i.    50,XX,+1,+del(1)(p13),+dup(1)(q21q32),+inv(1)(p31q41),+8,r(10)(p12q25),–21[10]
         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample in a female shows four abnormalities involving different chromosome 1 homo-

                    A female karyotype shows two abnormalities involving one chromosome 8 described using the short system (karyo-
                    type format). Chromosome 8 is described as a derivative chromosome with the structural aberrations listed from
                    the distal short (p) arm to the distal long (q) arm, rather than in alphabetical order, following the pter to qter rule.
                    The ISCN description using the detailed system (karyotype format) would be

                    Microarray shows an apparently terminal single copy loss of the short arm of chromosome 8 involving the segment
                    8p23.3 to 8p23.1 and an interstitial single copy gain of the segment segment 8p23.1 to 8p21.3.

             i.     52,XX,+7,+12,+13,+17,+r,+mar,12∼20dmin[10]
                    A female karyotype with 52 chromosomes in a neoplastic sample. The ring chromosome (r) is listed before the
                    marker (mar) and the double minutes (dmin) are given after a marker chromosome.

        g. Derivative chromosomes whose centromere is unknown (see Section 5.5.3) are placed after all iden-
           tified abnormalities but before unidentified ring chromosomes, marker chromosomes, and double
           minutes.
             i.     52,XX,+12,+13,+17,+der(?)t(?;6)(?;q16),+r,+mar,5∼9dmin[10]
                    A female karyotype with 52 chromosomes in a neoplastic sample. Abnormalities are given in chromosome order,
                    and derivative chromosomes that can be partly identified are given before ring chromosomes, marker chromosomes
                    and double minutes of unknown origin.




4.4          Nomenclature Rules

4.4.1        Spaces

           Spaces are not given in the ISCN description except for the following three scenarios:
        a. A space is always present between the abbreviations for the technique used (+/– genome build) and
           the result.
             i.     46,XY.ish 4p16.3(D4F26,WHS,D4S96)×2
             ii.    nuc ish (TP73×1,ANGPTL×2)[107/200]

             i.     nuc ish (MYH11,CBFB)×3(MYH11 con CBFB)×2[100/200]
                    In situ hybridization of 200 nuclei shows colocalization of MYH11 and CBFB in 100 nuclei and a normal hybrid-
                    ization signal pattern in 100 nuclei. The number of normal nuclei is inferred from the denominator.

                                  DOI: 10.1159/000538512
           ii.   46,XY,add(1)(q42) or dup(1)(q42q44)
                 An abnormal chromosome 1 in a male individual has arisen by an unknown mechanism as shown by the use of
                 add(1) or by a duplication involving bands 1q42 to 1q44.




4.4.2      Identification of Homologous Chromosomes

        a. To distinguish homologous chromosomes when both are involved in an abnormality (numerical or
           structural), one of the numerals may be underlined (_).
           i.    46,XY,t(5;8)(q23;q24),t(5;11)(p12;p11.1)
                 A male karyotype with different translocations involving both chromosome 5 homologues. Single underlining may
                 be used to distinguish between the homologues. As these are different homologues, the t(5;8) is listed before the
                 t(5;11) following the chromosome order rule, i.e., the partner chromosome determines the numerical order.




4.4.3      Number of Signals or Copies

        a. A multiplication (×) sign can be used to describe two or more copies of a structurally rearranged
           chromosome. The number of copies (×2, ×3, etc.) should be placed after the abnormality. The mul-
           tiplication (×) sign should not be used to denote multiple copies of normal chromosomes (see ex-
           ception for targeted chromosome analysis in Section 10.2.1).
           i.    47,XY,+5,del(5)(q13q33)×2[15]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows an interstitial deletion of the long arm of two chromosome 5 homologues.
                 The remaining chromosome 5 is apparently normal.

        b. In in situ hybridization a multiplication (×) sign and the number of signals seen is given outside
           the parentheses (( )) when the number of copies for each probe is the same. If the copy number dif-
           fers between probes within the same hybridization, the multiplication (×) sign is given for each
           probe inside the parentheses.
           i.    nuc ish (RB1,D21S259/D21S341/D21S342)×2
                 In situ hybridization shows two signals for the RB1 probe and the D21S259/D21S341/D21S342 contig. The ×2
                 applies to all probes and is given outside the parenthesis. Note: D21S259 could be given on its own in the ISCN
                 description and the other chromosome 21 contig probes must then be given in the text of the report.

           ii.   nuc ish (MYC×2,IGH×3)[90/200]
                 In situ hybridization in a neoplastic sample using a D8Z2/MYC/IGH probe set shows three signals for IGH probe
                 and two signals for the MYC probe. The multiplication (×) sign is associated individually with each probe. Note:
                 cell numbers must be given for neoplastic samples. The control probe, D8Z2, need not be given as both MYC and
                 control probes show a normal signal pattern (see Chapter 7).

           iii. 46,XX.rsa (X,13,18,21)×2
                 Apparently normal female karyotype and normal copy number of chromosomes X, 13, 18, and 21 using a region-
                 specific assay (e.g., QF-PCR).




4.4.4      Breakpoint Designation

        a. The location of a breakpoint(s) is specified by the band in which that break has occurred, e.g.,
           17p13.1
           • If a break can be localized to a band and not a subband, then the band may be specified, e.g.,
              17p13
           • Likewise, if a breakpoint can be localized only to a region but not to a particular band, then the
              region number may be specified, e.g., 17p1


        General Rules                                 Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                             25
                                                      DOI: 10.1159/000538512
        b. In the detailed system (karyotype format) the aberrations are listed according to the breakpoints of
           the derivative chromosome from pter to qter and are not separated by a comma (see Section 4.7).
           If a rearrangement is confined to a single chromosome, the chromosome number is not repeated in
           the band description. If more than one chromosome is involved, the bands and chromosome ends
           are identified with the appropriate chromosome numbers (see Section 5.4.2.2).
             i.    46,XY,der(9)(pter→p23::p13→p23::p13→q22::q33→qter)
                   A male karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 9 from an intrachromosomal rearrangement. The chromosome
                   number is not repeated before each breakpoint because all the breakpoints are within chromosome 9.

             ii.   46,XY,der(7)(7pter→7q22::2q21→2qter)
                   A male karyotype shows chromosomes 2 and 7 are involved in this derivative chromosome. The chromosome num-
                   ber is reported for each breakpoint in the brackets.

        c. A mixture of the short and detailed systems (karyotype format) can be used in the ISCN description
           but are not intermixed to describe abnormalities of a single chromosome.
             i.    46,XX,der(2)t(2;5)(p23;q35),der(8)(22qter→22q12::8q22→8q13::8p22→8q13::8p22→8p23::17q21
                   →17qter)[10]
                   Karyotype of a female neoplastic sample shows a derivative chromosome 2 and a derivative chromosome 8. The
                   derivative chromosome 2 is written using the short system (karyotype format) and is derived from a translocation
                   between 2p23 and 5q35. The derivative chromosome 8 is written using the detailed system (karyotype format) and
                   involves multiple rearrangements involving chromosomes 8, 17, and 22, in addition to a pericentric inversion of
                   chromosome 8 (see Section 5.5.10 for more examples involving inversions). Note: when using the detailed system
                   (karyotype format), derivative chromosomes are written from pter to qter with respect to the orientation of the
                   segment containing the centromere.

        d. For interstitial deletions or duplications where both breakpoints are within the same chromosome
           band, both breakpoints are given when describing the aberration using the karyotype format but the
           breakpoint is only given once when using the microarray format (see Table 4 and Section 4.7).


4.4.5        Nucleotide Position

        a. The genomic coordinates that are used in cytogenomic nomenclature for microarrays (arr), region-
           specific assays (rsa), genome mapping (ogm) and sequencing (seq) are defined in the translation
           tables provided by NCBI (hg38/GRCh38): http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/data-
           base/cytoBand.txt.gz
        b. When nucleotide coordinates are used to define an abnormal result, the genome build (e.g.,
           [GRCh38]) must be specified within the ISCN. The genome build follows immediately after the
           technique with no space, as illustrated in Chapters 8–11. There is a space between the genome build
           in square brackets [GRCh38] and the remainder of the ISCN description.
        c. The genome build is not included in the ISCN if the nucleotide coordinates are not reported, e.g.,
           when describing normal results or when using the abbreviated system (microarray format) to de-
           scribe whole chromosome aneuploidy (see Sections 4.7 and 8.2.2). The genome build should be
           provided in the report.
        d. The nucleotide numbers are given either with or without commas to indicate thousands and millions,
           but the use of commas (,) is recommended to improve readability. Note: commas are not used in
           the extended system (microarray format) since they confound the copy number (see Sections 4.7
           and 8.1.1).
        e. The span of abnormal nucleotides is separated by an underscore (_), in line with the Human Ge-
           nome Variation Society (HGVS) recommendations (www.HGVS.org/varnomen) for molecular ge-
           netic nomenclature.
        f. Band designations of only the abnormal genomic regions are shown. Abnormal regions of the sex
           chromosomes are listed first (X before Y) followed by autosomes, which are listed from lowest to
           highest number chromosome. Note: conventional cytogenetic banding assignments are those de-


        26                      Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224             ISCN 2024
                                DOI: 10.1159/000538512
             rived from banded chromosomes, while the microarray/sequencing banding assignments are those
             derived from genome browsers. These are not always concordant (see Section 2.4).
             i.   46,X,der(Y)t(Y;20)(q11.23;q13.2).arr[GRCh38] Yq11.23q12(24,741,599_57,191,562)×0,20q13.2
                  q13.33(53,224,067_63,743,732)×3
                  A derivative Y chromosome from an unbalanced translocation involving Yq11.23 and 20q13.2 by conventional
                  karyotype. There is no normal Y chromosome in this individual. Microarray shows an apparently terminal loss of
                  part of the long arm of the Y chromosome and gain of an apparently terminal segment of the long arm of chromo-
                  some 20. Note: when the abnormality involves one of the sex chromosomes, the normal sex chromosome is listed
                  first in the ISCN description followed by the abnormal sex chromosome (see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.3).
          g. In complex microarray or genome mapping results, as may be the case in neoplastic studies, the
             laboratory may choose to display results using ISCN in a tabular form instead of in a string (see
             Section 8.2.7, Tables 9, 10 and 11 for examples). The information in the table must include the chro-
             mosomes and bands corresponding to the abnormality, the type of abnormality (e.g., loss, gain, am-
             plification, translocation, inversion or region of homozygosity), the genomic coordinates of the
             abnormality, and the proportion of the sample with the abnormality where applicable. When the
             tabular form is used the genome build is designated in the table.
          h. A mixture of the abbreviated, short and extended systems (microarray format) and the abbreviated,
             short and detailed systems (karyotype format) can be used in the ISCN description but are not in-
             termixed to describe a single abnormality (see examples in Chapters 8, 9, 10 and 11).


4.4.6        Gene Symbols

          a. Although gene symbols are usually italicized, they are not italicized in the ISCN description.


4.4.6.1      Gene Fusions


          a. The gene fusion definition has been harmonized between ISCN, the Human Genome Organisation
             (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee, Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC)
             Gene Fusion Specification, and HGVS (Bruford et al., 2021). Gene fusions occur when two or more
             genes join and result in a chimeric transcript and/or a novel interaction between a rearranged regu-
             latory element with the expressed product of a partner gene (a regulatory fusion).
          b. A double colon (::) is used in the ISCN description to identify fusion genes in rsa and ogm nomen-
             clature only.


4.5          Clones, Mosaicism and Chimeras

4.5.1        Clones

          a. A clone is a cell population derived from a single progenitor.
          b. When several cells have the same or a closely related abnormal chromosome complement, the clon-
             al origin may be inferred. A clone is therefore not necessarily completely homogeneous.
             • There must be at least two metaphases with the same chromosome gain or structural rearrange-
                 ment for the abnormality to be accepted as clonal.
             • The same chromosome loss must occur in at least three metaphases to be accepted as clonal.
                 However, identical losses in two metaphases with the same clonal chromosome gain or struc-
                 tural aberration(s) may also be considered clonal and included in the nomenclature at the labo-
                 ratory’s discretion.



          General Rules                               Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                           27
                                                      DOI: 10.1159/000538512
             i.   46,XY,del(5)(q13q33),–7,+8[2]/46,XY[18]
                  A neoplastic clone with an interstitial deletion of 5q13 to 5q33, monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 in two metaphases. The
                  monosomy 7 can be included in the ISCN description as both metaphases have the same structural rearrangement
                  and chromosome gain.

        c. Clonality may need to be defined operationally. The criteria for acceptance will depend on, e.g., the
           number of metaphases examined, the nature of the aberration involved, the type of culture, and the
           time cells spend in vitro prior to harvest.
        d. Where in situ preparations are analyzed in neoplasia, the abnormality must meet the above criteria
           and be from either different primary cultures, or from well-separated areas or different cell colonies
           on the same culture.
        e. When the same abnormal clone has been found in an initial and follow-up study, even in a single
           metaphase, it should be reported in the karyotype.
             i.   46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[1]/46,XX[19]
                  A neoplastic clone with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The t(9;22) was seen in the initial sample.




4.5.2        Mosaicism and Chimerism

        a. Mosaicism (mos) is the presence of two or more cell lines derived from the same zygote.
           • Mosaicism may occur pre- or post-zygotically.
        b. Chimerism (chi) is the presence of two or more cell lines originating from different zygotes.
           • Chimerism may occur by fusion of gametes or embryos or may occur as a result of organ or stem
               cell transplantation.
        c. In microarray nomenclature mos is not used.
        d. Where in situ preparations are analyzed in constitutional samples, the abnormality must meet the
           following criteria and be from either different primary cultures, or from well-separated areas or dif-
           ferent cell colonies on the same culture:
           • There must be at least two metaphases with the same chromosome gain or structural rearrange-
               ment for the abnormality to be accepted as clonal.
           • The same chromosome loss must occur in at least three metaphases to be accepted as clonal.
               However, identical losses in two metaphases with the same clonal chromosome gain or struc-
               tural aberration(s) may also be considered clonal and included in the nomenclature at the labo-
               ratory’s discretion.


4.5.3        Nomenclature for Clones, Mosaics and Chimeras

        a. The karyotype designations of different clones or cell lines are separated by a slant line (/). The
           exception is that karyotypes of chimeras due to stem cell transplantation are separated by a double
           slant line (//).
        b. Square brackets ([ ]), placed after the karyotype description, are used to designate the absolute
           number of metaphases in each cell line or clone.
        c. Multiple clones in neoplastic samples are given in order of size if they are unrelated and in order of
           complexity if they are cytogenetically related.
        d. Multiple cell lines with constitutional abnormalities are given according to their size; the largest
           first, then the second largest, and so on. Likewise, the largest cell line in chimeras is presented first
           and where discernable, in SNP microarray and genome mapping.

                               DOI: 10.1159/000538512
e. The normal cell line is always listed last even if it is the largest.
     i.    mos 45,X[15]/47,XXX[10]/46,XX[23]
           Sex chromosome mosaicism in a female with the largest abnormal cell line listed first and the normal cell line last.

f. The exception is chimerism from stem cell transplants where the donor cell line is listed last.
g. When the metaphase numbers are the same, the XX cell line is always listed before the XY when
   neither shows an abnormality.
h. To distinguish between mosaic (mos) and chimeric (chi) cell lines, the respective abbreviation may
   be used preceding the karyotype designation, with a space following the abbreviation.
i. The use of mos or chi is optional. In most instances the abbreviation will be given only in the initial
   ISCN description in a report, e.g., mos 45,X[10]/46,XX[10] and chi 46,XX[10]/46,XY[10]
     i.    45,X[10]/46,XX[20]
           Mosaic karyotype with one cell line having one X chromosome in ten metaphases and a second cell line with a
           normal diploid female pattern in 20 metaphases.

     ii.   chi 46,XY[25]/46,XX[10]
           An XY/XX chimera with the larger cell line listed first.

     iii. 46,XX[5]//46,XY[25]
           Incomplete engraftment in a female recipient following stem cell transplant with male donor cells.

j.   In neoplasia, individual neoplastic clones and, if present, constitutional cell lines are listed in the
     following order irrespective of clone size or complexity:
     • abnormal clones with an acquired abnormality,
     • cell lines with a constitutional abnormality,

     i.    45,XY,–21[5]/47,XY,+21c[10]/46,XY[10]
           Neoplastic sample with acquired loss of chromosome 21 in an individual with mosaic Down syndrome.

     ii.   47,XY,t(8;14)(q11.2;q32),+21c[5]/47,XY,+21c[7]/46,XY[10]
           A neoplastic clone with a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14 in an individual with mosaic Down
           syndrome.
k. When the number of abnormal metaphases in constitutional cell lines or neoplastic unrelated clones
   is equivalent, or the complexity of clones in cytogenetically related neoplastic clones is equivalent,
   their order in the ISCN description is determined by the sequential application of the following rules
   (see also Section 6.3.3 for neoplasia examples):
   • Where abnormalities in different clones/cell lines involve chromosomes of a different number,
       the chromosome order rule applies, X before Y, followed by autosomes in increasing number,
       e.g.,
       Constitutional cell lines: 47,XXX[25]/47,XX,+21[25]/46,XX[10]
       Unrelated neoplastic clones: 47,XX,+8[25]/47,XX,+21[25]
       Related neoplastic clones: 45,XY,–5,t(7;11)(p15;p15)[10]/45,XY,–7,t(7;11)(p15;p15)[15]
   • When the same chromosome is involved, gains are listed before losses before structural change,
       e.g.,
       Constitutional cell lines: 45,X[25]/46,X,i(X)(q10)[25]/46,XX[25]
       Unrelated neoplastic clones: 47,XY,+5[25]/46,XY,del(5)(q13q33)[25]/46,XY[10]
       Related neoplastic clones: 47,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2),+19[5]/45,XX,t(9;22),–19[10]
   • Structural abnormalities of the same number chromosome are listed alphabetically, e.g.,
       Constitutional cell lines: 46,X,del(X)(q13)[25]/46,X,i(X)(q10)[25]/46,XX[25]
       Unrelated neoplastic clones: 46,XX,add(7)(q34)[10]/46,XX,del(7)(q22)[10]
       Related neoplastic clones: 46,XX,del(7)(q22),+8[10]/46,XX,i(7)(q10),+8[12]

     •   Where the same type of abnormality is detected on the same chromosome, the pter to qter rule
         applies, e.g.,
         Constitutional cell lines: 46,XY,del(5)(p15.31)[10]/46,XY,del(5)(p15.2)[10]
         Unrelated neoplastic clones: 46,XX,del(13)(q13q14)[10]/46,XX,del(13)(q14q22)[10]/46,XX[2]

l.   When a single abnormal metaphase is detected with one technique and confirmed by a different
     method (e.g., in situ hybridization) and thus shown to be clonal, it is reported in the ISCN descrip-
     tion. When additional abnormalities are seen in a single metaphase, but not proven to be present
     with another method, they should not be listed in the nomenclature but, if appropriate, may be dis-
     cussed in the interpretation.
     i.    46,XX,del(20)(q11.2q13.3)[1]/46,XX[19].nuc ish (D20S108)×1[40/200]
           A neoplastic clone with an interstitial deletion of 20q11.2 to 20q13.3 seen in one metaphase and confirmed by in-
           terphase in situ hybridization. Note: the abnormal in situ hybridization interphase result must be above the labora-
           tory reporting threshold.

     ii.   47,XX,+8[1]/46,XX[19].nuc ish (D8Z2)×1[30/200]
           Karyotype shows an additional chromosome 8 in one metaphase and is confirmed as a mosaic trisomy 8 by inter-
           phase in situ hybridization.

m. In chimerism secondary to stem cell transplant, the recipient clone(s) are listed first, followed by
   the donor clone(s).
     i.    46,XY[3]//46,XX[17]
           Karyotype shows three metaphases from the male recipient and 17 metaphases from the female donor.

     ii    //46,XX[20]
           Karyotype shows that all 20 metaphases are derived from the female donor.

     iii. 46,XY[20]//
           Karyotype shows that all 20 metaphases are derived from the male recipient.

     iv. 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[4]//46,XX[16]
           Karyotype shows four male recipient metaphases with a 9;22 translocation and 16 apparently normal female donor
           metaphases.

     v.    46,XX[5]//45,XX,der(13;14)(q10;q10)c[15]
           Karyotype shows five metaphases from the female recipient and 15 metaphases from the donor. The donor cells
           can be distinguished by the presence of a constitutional Robertsonian translocation involving chromosomes 13 and
           14.

n. If present in cytogenomic results (arr, ogm, rsa, seq), clonality/mosaicism must be indicated in the
   ISCN description as follows (see Chapters 8–11):
   • An estimate of the proportion of the sample with the abnormality, or the variant allele frequen-
       cy (VAF) of the abnormality is reported in square brackets ([ ]) immediately following the
       abnormality.
   • If it is not possible to determine the level of mosaicism, a question mark (?) may be used in
       square brackets ([ ]) in place of the VAF or sample proportion.
   • Alternatively where the level of mosaicism cannot be determined, a tilde (~) may be used to
       indicate a range of copy numbers.
   • Amplification (amp) may be used when there are too many signals to allow enumeration and
       the amplification meets the clinical criterion for gene amplification in the disease under inves-
       tigation.
   • The abbreviation mos is not used in ISCN for molecular cytogenomic results.

                large to be enumerated accurately by microarray and the proportion of the sample with the amplification cannot be

                Genome mapping shows a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 17 resulting in a RERE::SMG6
                fusion gene with a VAF of 30%. There is an interstitial deletion of 6q and an apparently terminal deletion of 12p,
                both losses are in 50% of this neoplastic sample.




4.6       Multiple Techniques

      a. Where multiple techniques are reported in the nomenclature, the karyotype (if undertaken) is always
         listed first. The order of the subsequent techniques is at the discretion of the laboratory. Subsequent
         techniques are separated by a period (.) to designate the beginning of the next result. Alternatively,
         multiple techniques can be listed on separate lines without a period (.).
      b. If an alternative technique clarifies the karyotype and, in retrospect, the abnormality can be visual-
         ized with banding, the karyotype may be amended to reflect this new information.
      c. If the abnormality is cryptic and cannot be visualized by banding, the abnormality is not listed in
         the banded karyotype.
          i.    46,XX,del(4)(q32q35).arr[GRCh38] 4q32.2q35.1(163,146,681_183,022,312)×1.ogm[GRCh38]

                Karyotype shows a large interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 4 in a female. The breakpoints are
                further delineated by microarray and genome mapping. Note: the nucleotides are likely to be different for microar-
                ray and genome mapping platforms. They are the same for this example as they are given only to demonstrate the
                nomenclature.

                SHANK3+)
                An interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22, which is detected by chromosome microarray and con-
                firmed by metaphase in situ hybridization. The microdeletion is not visible in the karyotype and is therefore not
                shown in the karyotype nomenclature.

      d. When the same structural abnormality is seen with different techniques or in different clones/sub-
         clones/cell lines, breakpoints do not need to be repeated unless their use clarifies or extends the
         breakpoints.

                A female karyotype with a reciprocal translocation 4;18 confirmed by in situ hybridization using painting probes
                for chromosomes 4 and 18. Breakpoints of the translocation are not repeated in the in situ hybridization result.

                der(7)t(7;15)(wcp7+,RP11–324E12–,wcp15+)
                A male karyotype with a derivative chromosome 7 with one normal chromosome 7 and one normal chromosome
                15. Due to unbalanced segregation, the derivative 15 is not present, hence the chromosome number of 45 and –15
                in the karyotype nomenclature. Breakpoints are not repeated in the in situ hybridization result.

                 A female karyotype of a neoplastic sample. The breakpoints of the inv(6) are not repeated in the sideline. The
                 marker is confirmed to be derived from chromosome 8 by in situ hybridization.

      e. When several techniques are used, the abbreviation mat, pat, inh, dmat, dpat or dinh is given in
         the nomenclature of the technique where the inheritance was first identified. The inheritance abbre-
         viation is not given in the ISCN description of subsequent technologies.

                 A paternally inherited translocation between the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chromosome 18,
                 seen with karyotype and in situ hybridization in a male individual. The abbreviation pat is only given once.

           ii.   46,XY.ish del(22)(q11.2q11.2)(TBX1–)mat
                 A maternally inherited interstitial deletion of the proximal part of the long arm of chromosome 22 in this male
                 sample. The abbreviation mat is given in the in situ hybridization part of the ISCN description as the del(22) is not
                 visible on conventional karyotype.

                 A maternally inherited interstitial loss in 7q35 detected by chromosome microarray and confirmed by in situ
                 hybridization. The abbreviation mat is associated with the technique performed first.

           iv. 46,XX,der(13)t(13;20)(q34;p13)dmat.ish der(13)(163C9–,dj1061L1+)
                 An unbalanced translocation between the distal long arm of chromosome 13 and the distal short arm of chromo-
                 some 20, inherited from a balanced maternal t(13;20). The subtelomeric region of 13q is deleted and replaced with
                 the subtelomeric region of the chromosome 20 short arm.



4.7        ISCN Formats

      a. The ISCN description uses two different formats depending on the technique used and/or the struc-
         tural information given by the assay:
         • Karyotype format based on chromosome bands, e.g., banded chromosome analysis (i.e., con-
             ventional karyotype), in situ hybridization, genome mapping, region-specific assays (RSA) and
             sequencing or
         • Microarray format based on molecular cytogenomic techniques, e.g., microarray, genome
             mapping, RSA, and sequencing.
      b. The karyotype format is described using the abbreviated, short, and detailed systems, while the
         microarray format is expressed using the abbreviated, short, and extended systems.
      c. For interstitial deletions or duplications where both breakpoints are within the same chromosome
         band, both breakpoints are given when describing the aberration using the karyotype format (see
         Section 4.7.1), but the breakpoint is only given once when using the microarray format (see Table
         4 and Section 4.7.2).

4.7.1      Karyotype Format

        a. The karyotype format describes the abnormality using chromosome bands (short and detailed sys-
           tems).
           • The abbreviated system defines each abnormality by only the chromosome number. It is appli-
              cable for in situ hybridization of sex determination and whole chromosome enumeration and
              targeted chromosome analysis.
                  ish 7(D7Z1)×1[20]/7(D7Z1)×2[15] (see Chapter 7).
                  rsa (21)×3[25]/(21)×2[5] (see Chapter 10).
           • The short system defines each abnormality by their breakpoints. However, with genome map-
              ping the short system includes the nucleotides without indicating the copy number, i.e.,
                  46,XX,del(5)(q13) (see Chapter 5).

4.7.2        Microarray Format

        a. The microarray format describes the abnormality using nucleotides (short and extended systems)
           and copy number. When describing normal results or whole chromosome aneuploidy or chromo-
           some arm aneuploidy the abbreviated system is used that does not include the nucleotides. The
           abbreviations pter and qter are not used in the ISCN microarray format.
        b. The abbreviated system (microarray format only) describes the abnormality/abnormalities with no
           breakpoints and no nucleotides, i.e.,
           arr (X,1–22)×3 (see Chapter 8).
           ogm (X,21)×3 (see Chapter 9).
           seq (13)×3 (see Chapter 11).
        c. The short system includes the breakpoints and nucleotides involved in the abnormality and copy
           number, i.e.,
           arr[GRCh38] 22q11.21(18,730,698_21,689,521)×1 (see Chapter 8).
           ogm[GRCh38] 22q11.21(18,730,698_21,689,521)×1 (see Chapter 9).
           seq[GRCh38] 10p15.3(49,086_2,944,634)×1dn (see Chapter 11).
        d. The extended system (microarray format only) describes the abnormality in detail including the
           flanking normal nucleotides, i.e.,
           arr[GRCh38] 22q11.21(18889117×2,18929329_21111370×1,21116218×2) (see Chapter 8).

5.1        General Principles

      a. For general rules that are also applicable to karyotype analysis, see Chapter 4.
      b. Symbols and abbreviations used to designate chromosome abnormalities are listed in Chapter 3.
      c. In the description of a karyotype based on banded chromosomes, the total number of chromosomes
         is listed first, followed by a comma (,), and then followed by the sex chromosomes.
      d. In the description of chromosome abnormalities, sex chromosome aberrations are given first, and X
         before Y, followed by abnormalities of the autosomes listed in numerical order. Each abnormality
         is separated by a comma (,) and listed in order, e.g., 48,XY,+18,+21 (see a summary below and
         Section 4.3).
         • Constitutional abnormalities are listed before acquired abnormalities of the same chromosome.
         • The normal sex chromosome is listed first in the ISCN description when the other sex chromo-
              some is abnormal (see Section 4.3).
         • For each chromosome numerical abnormalities are given before structural changes. Gains are
              given before losses and before structural abnormalities.
         • Where abnormalities are on the same chromosome homologue they are given in pter to qter
              order as they lie on the abnormal chromosome. The orientation of the abnormal chromosome is
              determined by the segment with the centromere.
         • Abnormalities on the same chromosome homologue involving the same chromosome band are
              given in alphabetical order according to the abbreviated term of the abnormality, e.g.,
              additional material (add) before deletion (del); deletion before derivative (der); derivative
              before duplication (dup) etc.


      36                 Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224   ISCN 2024
                         DOI: 10.1159/000538512
    •  Structural changes involving both homologous chromosomes are given in alphabetical order ac-
       cording to the abbreviated term of the abnormality.
e. A normal diploid cell line, when present, is always listed last.
f. A plus (+) sign or a minus (–) sign may be used to indicate gain or loss of chromosomes (see Sec-
   tion 5.3).
   • The plus (+) sign or minus (–) sign is given before a structurally normal or abnormal autosome
       to indicate autosomal aneuploidy in constitutional and in neoplastic samples.
   • The plus (+) sign or minus (–) sign is given to describe acquired sex chromosome aneuploidy
       in neoplastic samples.
   • The plus (+) sign or minus (–) sign are not used to indicate constitutional numerical sex chro-
       mosome abnormalities i.e., all sex chromosomes comprising the constitutional sex chromosome
       complement are given after the chromosome number, without indicating copy gain or loss (see
       examples in Section 5.3.1).
g. In the situations described below, the plus (+) sign and the minus (–) sign may be used in the inter-
   pretive comments but are NOT used in the ISCN description.
   • To indicate an increase or decrease in the length of a chromosome arm (p or q) the plus (+) or
       minus (–) signs may be placed after the arm abbreviation, e.g., 4p+, 5q– in the text.
   • For benign variable chromosome features (see Section 2.5.1), to indicate an increase or decrease
       in arm length by placing a plus (+) or minus (–) sign after the appropriate abbreviation, e.g.,
       ps+. Heterochromatic variants are not included in the ISCN description but may be included in
       the text (see Chapter 2).
h. The multiplication (×) sign can be used to describe multiple copies of a rearranged chromosome
   but is not used to denote multiple copies of normal chromosomes (see Sections 4.4.3 and 5.6).
i. To distinguish homologous chromosomes, one of the numerals may be underlined (_) (see Section
   4.4.2).
j. Uncertainty in chromosome, in band designation or in the type of aberration may be indicated by a
   question mark (?) or a tilde (~) (see Section 4.2.1). The term or is used to indicate alternative in-
   terpretations of an aberration (see Section 4.2.1).
k. The number of metaphases examined is indicated in square brackets ([ ]), where there is constitu-
   tional mosaicism and for all ISCN descriptions of neoplastic samples.
l. The karyotype designations of different clones or cell lines are separated by a slant line (/) (see Sec-
   tion 4.5.3).
m. Mosaic (mos) cell lines originate from the same zygote and chimeric (chi) cell lines originate from
   different zygotes (See Section 4.5). In constitutional cases, mos or chi may precede the karyotype
   designation and are followed by a space before the total chromosome number. The use of the ab-
   breviations mos or chi is optional.
n. To describe more than one cell line (see Sections 4.5.3 and 6.3.3) the following applies:
   • Where there is an abnormality in more than one cell line, these are given according to their size;
       the largest is given first and a normal cell line, if present is listed last, e.g., mos
       45,X[15]/47,XXX[10]/46,XX[23].
   • When the different cell lines are found in equal numbers, the order is determined by the se-
       quential application of the following rules:
       − A numerical abnormality is listed first before a structural abnormality.
       − Cell lines with gains of the same chromosome are given before cell lines with loss of the same
           chromosome and losses are given before structural aberrations of the same chromosome.
       − When both cell lines have numerical abnormalities, alterations of sex chromosomes are given
           first, followed by autosome number in chromosome order, e.g., 47,XX,+X[25]/47,XX,+21[25].
   • For rules to describe chimerism secondary to stem cell transplant see Section 4.5.3.
   • To describe a constitutional chimera where the number of metaphases are different for the cell
       lines, the largest cell line is listed first, e.g., chi 46,XY[25]/46,XX[10].


Karyotype                                Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                   37
                                         DOI: 10.1159/000538512
               •    To describe a constitutional chimera where cell lines are of equal numbers the XX cell line is
                    listed before the XY cell line, e.g., chi 46,XX[10]/46,XY[10].
          o.   When it is known that a chromosome aberration is inherited, the term inh is used. When the parent
               of origin is known, it can be designated maternal (mat) or paternal (pat). If only part of a parental
               aberration is inherited, the abbreviation dmat, dpat or dinh is used (see Section 4.2.1).
          p.   The same rules are followed to designate the type of chromosome aberrations in the description of
               constitutional and acquired chromosome aberrations. Specific terms and recommendations related
               to abnormalities seen in neoplasia are described in Chapter 6.
          q.   When an acquired abnormality is found in an individual with a constitutional chromosome anoma-
               ly, the constitutional aberration is indicated by the letter c immediately after the constitutional ab-
               normality designation (see Sections 4.2.1, 5.3.1.2 and 6.4).
          r.   In the interest of clarity, complex rearrangements necessitating descriptions using the detailed
               system (karyotype format) should be written out in full the first time they are used in the report. The
               short system (karyotype format) version may be used subsequently.
          s.   The breakpoints of a rearranged chromosome(s) need not be repeated in any subsequent description
               of the same rearrangement or derivative of it.
          t.   In neoplasia an incomplete karyotype (inc) is used when the chromosome quality is too poor to al-
               low complete chromosome analysis. The karyotype is thus likely to contain unidentified structural
               or numerical changes in addition to the abnormalities listed (see Section 6.3.6).


5.2            Normal Results

               The normal karyotype is designated as follows:
               i.    46,XX
                     Karyotype shows an apparently normal female.

               ii.   46,XY
                     Karyotype shows an apparently normal male.

               iii. 46,U
                     Karyotype shows no evidence of an abnormality, and the sex chromosomes are not disclosed (i.e., U replaces XX
                     or XY).

                   metaphases is equal in each cell line, the cell line with an extra sex chromosome is listed first following the rule
                   gains before losses (see Sections 4.5.3 and 5.1).

             viii. 45,X[25]/47,XXX[12]/46,XX[13]

                   Karyotype shows an acquired clonal gain of one X chromosome in a neoplastic sample of an individual with Turn-
                   er syndrome. Note: the plus (+) sign is given to designate the acquired clonal gain of a sex chromosome. For use
                   of the letter (c) to describe constitutional abnormalities in neoplastic samples see Sections 4.3 and 6.4.

             ii.   45,X,–X[8]

                   Note: +21 is listed before –21 following the rule that a constitutional abnormality is listed before an acquired ab-
                   normality of the same chromosome (see Sections 5.1 and 6.4).

             vii. 47,XY,+8[15]/46,XY[5]

5.4          Structural Abnormalities

5.4.1        Specification of Chromosomes and Breakpoints

        a. In single chromosome rearrangements, the abbreviation identifying the type of rearrangement is
           listed before the chromosome involved in the change. The chromosome involved is specified with-
           in parentheses (( )) and is followed by the breakpoint in a second set of parentheses (( )).
        b. The location of a breakpoint(s) is specified by the band in which the break has occurred. Where the
           breakpoint appears to be at the interface between two bands the breakpoint is assigned to the higher
           of the two band numbers, i.e., the number of the band more distal to the centromere.


        40                      Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                ISCN 2024
                                DOI: 10.1159/000538512
c. A breakpoint may appear to be in either of two consecutive bands. A similar situation may occur
   when breakpoints at or near an interface between two bands are studied with different banding tech-
   niques. In this event, the breakpoint can be specified by both band numbers separated by the term
   or, e.g., 1q23 or 1q24, indicating a break in either band 1q23 or band 1q24 (see Section 4.2.1).
d. If a breakpoint can be localized to a region but not a particular band then it may be specified giving
   only the region, e.g., 1p3. If the band but not subband is discernable then it may be given as, e.g.,
   1p34. If the subband is identifiable then it is specified in the breakpoint description, e.g., 1p34.1
   • Some bands at 300 bands per haploid set (bphs) do not resolve into separate bands and are
        designated with a hyphen (-), e.g., 20q11.2–13.1
e. Alternatively, uncertainty of breakpoints may be indicated by a question mark (?), e.g., 1p1? (see
   Section 4.2.1) or by a tilde (~), e.g., 1p34∼p35 (see Section 4.2.1).
f. Breakpoint(s) of rearrangement(s) reported in the ISCN description may be at different levels of
   resolution reflecting the banding resolution, and hence the precision of the karyotype. The overall
   banding resolution is reported in accordance with the national guidelines as applicable and not in-
   cluded in the ISCN description.
g. If two or more chromosomes are involved in a rearrangement, chromosome numbers and breakpoint
   positions are separated by a semicolon (;).
h. If the rearrangement involves a single chromosome the breakpoints are not separated by a semicolon
   (;), e.g., inv(2)(p23q11.2), del(4)(p15.3p16.1), r(18)(p11.2q23)
i. If one of the rearranged chromosomes is a sex chromosome, then it is listed first. When both X and
   Y chromosomes are involved in a rearrangement, the X chromosome is listed before the Y chromo-
   some. Otherwise, the chromosome having the lowest number is always specified first, e.g., t(X;3)
   (p22.1;p21.3) and t(2;5)(p23;p13.3)
j. An exception to the rule (i) above is an interchromosomal insertion (ins) in which part of one chro-
   mosome is inserted at a point of breakage in another chromosome. The recipient chromosome is
   specified first, regardless of whether it is a sex chromosome or an autosome with a number higher
   or lower than that of the donor chromosome, e.g., ins(5;2)(p14;q22q32) and ins(3;X)(q21;p22.1p11.23)
   (see Section 5.5.9).
k. Normal chromosomes that are replaced by structurally altered chromosomes are not recorded in the
   ISCN description as missing. In the description of karyotypes containing dicentric chromosomes or
   derivative chromosomes resulting from whole-arm translocations, the abnormal chromosomes by
   convention replace both normal chromosomes involved in the formation of the dicentric chromo-
   some or derivative chromosome. Thus, in these situations the two missing chromosomes are not
   specified (see Sections 5.5.4 and 5.5.18.2).
   i.    46,XX,inv(3)(q21q26.2)[15]
         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows an inversion of one chromosome 3 replacing one normal chromosome 3
         homologue in a female. There is no need to indicate that one chromosome 3 is missing, i.e., the karyotype must not
         be written 46,XX,–3,+inv(3)(q21q26.2)[15]

   ii.   46,Y,t(X;8)(p22.3;q24.1)
         Karyotype shows a balanced translocation between the X chromosome and chromosome 8 in a male. Note: the
         normal sex chromosome, in this example the Y chromosome, is listed first.

   iii. 45,XX,dic(13;15)(q22;q24)
         Karyotype shows a translocation between chromosomes 13 and 15 involving bands 13q22 and 15q24 resulting in
         a dicentric (dic) chromosome in a female. Note: it is apparent from the total chromosome number in the ISCN de-
         scription that the dicentric chromosome replaces the two normal chromosomes (see Section 5.5.4).

   iv. 46,XY,der(1)t(1;3)(p22;q13.1)
         Karyotype shows an abnormal chromosome 1 that results from an unbalanced segregation of a translocation between
         chromosomes 1 and 3 in a male. The der(1) replaces a normal chromosome 1 and there is no need to indicate the
         missing normal chromosome. The description implies that the karyotype contains one normal chromosome 1, a
         derivative chromosome 1 and two normal chromosomes 3.

               v.   46,XX,der(1)ins(1;?)(p22;?)
                    Karyotype shows material of unknown origin is inserted in chromosome 1 within band 1p22 in a female. The
                    homologous chromosome 1 is normal.

               vi. 46,XY,–10,+der(17)t(10;17)(q22;p12)
                    Karyotype shows an additional abnormal chromosome 17 that is a derivative of a translocation involving chromo-
                    somes 10 and 17, and two normal chromosomes 17 in a male. In this situation the missing chromosome 10 must be
                    indicated.




5.4.2          Karyotype Format for Designating Structural Chromosome Abnormalities

          a. There are two systems within the karyotype format for designating structural abnormalities, the short
             system (karyotype format) and the detailed system (karyotype format) (see Section 4.7).
          b. The short and detailed systems (karyotype format) may be combined in the ISCN description, but
             each derivative must be described using only a single system.
               i.   46,XX,inv(9)(p23q22),der(11)(11pter→11q12::5q11.2→5q23::8q24.1→8qter)
                    A female karyotype with a pericentric inversion of chromosome 9 written with the short system (karyotype format)
                    and a derivative 11 written with the detailed system (karyotype format). The abnormal chromosome 11 has result-
                    ed from a complex translocation involving chromosomes 5, 8 and 11, t(5;8;11;5)(q23;q24.1;q12;q11.2)




5.4.2.1        Short System (Karyotype Format) for Designating Structural Chromosome Abnormalities


          a. In the short system (karyotype format), structural abnormalities are defined by their breakpoints.
             The breakpoints are specified within parentheses (()) immediately following the abbreviation of
             the type of rearrangement and the chromosome(s) involved. The breakpoints are identified by band
             designations and are listed in the same order as the chromosomes.
          b. Arrows are not used in the short system (karyotype format).
          c. For very complex abnormalities, the short system (karyotype format) may lack clarity compared to
             the detailed system (karyotype format), although the short system (karyotype format) will provide
             information on all breakpoints involved in the generation of an abnormal chromosome.


5.4.2.2        Detailed System (Karyotype Format) for Designating Structural Chromosome Abnormalities


          a. Structurally altered chromosomes are defined by their band composition. The conventions used in
             the short system (karyotype format) are maintained in the detailed system (karyotype format), except
             in the detailed system (karyotype format) the description of the band composition of the rearranged
             chromosome(s) is specified in the parentheses (()) with the breakpoints.
          b. In the detailed system (karyotype format) the ISCN description starts at the end of the short arm and
             proceeds to the end of the long arm (pter to qter), with the bands being identified in the order in
             which they occur in the rearranged chromosome.
             • The aberrations are listed according to the breakpoints of the rearranged chromosome from pter
                 to qter and not separated by a comma (,).
             • If the rearrangement is confined to a single chromosome, the chromosome number is not re-
                 peated in the band description.
                  − The terminal end of a single chromosome arm may be designated using the abbreviation ter
                     preceded by the arm designation, i.e., qter and pter
             • If more than one chromosome is involved, the bands and/or terminal ends are identified with the
                 appropriate chromosome numbers (see Section 4.4.4).


          42                     Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224             ISCN 2024
                                 DOI: 10.1159/000538512
                 − If the abnormality involves different chromosomes, then the chromosome number precedes
                     pter or qter, i.e., 3pter and 7qter
             • When the breakpoint of the chromosome(s) is not at the terminal end then the chromosome band
                 designation should be used.
          c. A single colon (:) is used to indicate a chromosome break and a double colon (::) to indicate break
             and reunion. To avoid an unwieldy description, an arrow (→ or –>), meaning from – to, is employed.
             The end of a chromosome arm may be designated either by its band designation or by terminal
             (ter), preceded by the arm designation, i.e., pter indicates the end of the short arm and qter the end
             of the long arm. When it is necessary to indicate the centromere, the abbreviation cen can be used.
          d. A derivative chromosome (der) is described according to the number and orientation of the chro-
             mosome providing the centromere.
          e. The description of a derivative chromosome begins at the end of the chromosome replacing the short
             arm of the original chromosome, even if the translocated segment is from a long arm or a chromo-
             some with a higher or lower chromosome number.
             i.    46,XY,der(5)(qter→q13::q10→q13::p15→p13)[20]
                   The karyotype of a neoplastic sample with a structurally altered chromosome 5 in 20 metaphases in a male. There
                   is a deletion of 5pter to 5p15 and of 5p13 to 5p10 (5q10 is present). Note: the orientation of the derivative chromo-
                   some 5 is determined by the segment 5q10 to 5q13 because it contains the centromere. The ISCN description begins
                   at 5qter because the segment 5qter to 5q13 replaces the chromosome 5 short arm.

             ii.   46,XX,der(8)(10qter→10q11.2::7q11.2→7q32::8p21→8q22::3p12→3pter)
                   The karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 8 in a female. The derivative chromosome consists of part of chro-
                   mosomes 10, 7, 8 and 3. The derivative 8 is described from pter to qter and is composed of 10qter to 10q11.2; a
                   chromosome 7 segment from 7q11.2 to 7q32; a segment of chromosome 8 involving 8p21 to 8q22 including the
                   centromere, and a chromosome 3 segment from 3p12 to 3pter. Note: the orientation of the derivative chromosome
                   8 is determined by the segment 8p21 to 8q22 that contains the centromere. The ISCN description begins at 10qter
                   to 10q11.2 because this is the most distal part of the material replacing the chromosome 8 short arm.
          f. Unbalanced segregation rearrangements will lead to at least one derivative chromosome, and in these
             situations the use of the abbreviation der to describe the derivative chromosome is recommended.
             It will usually not be possible to adequately describe all the complex rearrangements in the short
             system. The detailed system (karyotype format) can be used to describe any abnormality. However,
             the karyotype must be described in words to ensure complete clarity.


5.4.3        Derivative and Recombinant Chromosomes

          a. Derivative (der) and recombinant (rec) chromosomes are structurally rearranged chromosomes
             that result from different mechanisms.


5.4.3.1      Derivative Chromosomes


          a. A derivative chromosome (der) is a structurally rearranged chromosome generated by a de novo
             mechanism or by meiotic malsegregation of an inherited balanced anomaly. It is characterized by:
             • more than one rearrangement within a single chromosome, e.g., an inversion and a deletion of
                 the same chromosome, or deletions in both arms of a single chromosome, or
             • rearrangements involving two or more chromosomes, e.g., the unbalanced product(s) of a trans-
                 location, or
             • an undetermined mechanism.
          b. The term derivative chromosome (der) refers to the chromosome(s) that has an intact centromere
             or neocentromere (for examples see Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.13).

                                                          DOI: 10.1159/000538512
c. In the short system (karyotype format), the derivative chromosome is specified in parentheses (())
   followed by the aberrations involved in the generation of the derivative chromosome. These are
   listed according to the breakpoints of the derivative chromosome from pter and qter and not sepa-
   rated by a comma (,).
d. An abnormal chromosome, in which no part can be identified, is referred to as a marker chromo-
   some (mar) (see Section 5.5.12).
e. In the detailed system (karyotype format), the abbreviations designating the abnormalities are omit-
   ted and only the band composition of the derivative chromosome is specified.
        As an illustration of how the derivative chromosomes can be written, a balanced reciprocal trans-
   location between chromosomes 2 and 5, 46,XX,t(2;5)(q21;q31) is represented by the pachytene
   diagram in Figure 5. The derivative chromosomes from this translocation are designated der(2) and
   der(5). Table 5 gives the possible unbalanced gametes resulting from adjacent-1 and adjacent-2 seg-
   regation. The table also shows four of the 12 possible 3:1 segregation products together with the
   designations of the karyotypes resulting from the fertilization between each unbalanced gametic type
   and a normal gamete. The karyotype designation needs to be written in full only once in the ISCN
   description after that it may be described without the breakpoints. A suggested abbreviation for the
   first designated karyotype in Table 5 is 46,XX,der(5)t(2;5)dmat

     possibilities and derivative chromosome combinations given in Table 5. Letters A, B, C, and D designate chromosome
     ends (telomeres). For the sake of simplicity only those two of the four chromatids that are involved in crossing-over (see
     Table 5) are indicated. Crosses mark the positions of crossing-over.

                Adjacent-2 disjunction minimally results in the first two unbalanced gametic types shown (AB AD, CD CB).
                Crossing-over in the interstitial segments between centromeres and points of exchange is necessary for the origin
                of the remaining four types.
              b A further eight segregants can occur if there is crossing-over in the interstitial segments, making a total of 12 types

                of gametes with three chromosomes derived from the translocation quadrivalent.




5.4.3.2      Recombinant Chromosomes


          a. A recombinant chromosome (rec) is a structurally rearranged chromosome with a new segmental
             composition resulting from meiotic crossing-over between a displaced segment and its normally
             located counterpart in certain types of structural heterozygotes, e.g., inversion or insertion hetero-
             zygotes.
          b. rec is inferred from the parental karyotype and is not to be used in the description of acquired chro-
             mosome abnormalities nor those resulting from malsegregation.
          c. In a recombinant chromosome (rec) there is a duplication and deletion of material. In the ISCN
             description the duplication (dup) is explicitly stated, and the deletion is inferred. See Figure 6 for
             a diagrammatic representation of a parental pericentric inversion (inv) of chromosome 2,
             46,XX,inv(2)(p21q31)
          d. The aberrations following the abbreviation rec are not separated by a comma (,):

           on original) are shown as black boxes on the short arm and as hatched boxes on the long arm. In the pachytene diagram,
           the cross indicates crossing-over within the inversion loop. For the sake of simplicity only those two of the four chroma-
           tids that are involved in crossing-over and give rise to the recombinant chromosomes are indicated.




5.5        Specification of Structural Rearrangements

           The types of structural rearrangements are listed below in alphabetical order and examples of con-
           stitutional and neoplastic structural rearrangement are given. The short system (karyotype format)
           is provided first, and when appropriate, an alternative detailed system (karyotype format) descrip-
           tion is also provided.




      46                      Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224               ISCN 2024
                              DOI: 10.1159/000538512
5.5.1      Additional Material of Unknown Origin

        a. The abbreviation add is used to indicate additional material of unknown origin that replaces the
           terminal segment of the chromosome. The abbreviation is recommended where the mechanism and
           origin of the segment cannot be ascertained.
        b. Depending on the size of the additional material of unknown origin, it may result in no change, or
           an increase or a decrease in the length of the chromosome. Designations such as 1p+ or 1p– may be
           used in the text to describe such abnormal chromosomes but is not used in the ISCN description (see
           Section 5.1).
           i.    46,XX,add(19)(p13.3)
                 or
                 46,XX,add(19)(?::p13.3→qter)
                 Karyotype shows additional material attached to band 19p13.3 and replacing 19pter to 19p13.3, but neither the
                 origin of the extra segment nor the type of rearrangement is known.

           ii.   46,XY,add(12)(q13)
                 or
                 46,XY,add(12)(pter→q13::?)
                 Karyotype shows additional material of unknown origin replacing the segment 12q13 to 12qter

        c. When additional material of unknown origin is attached to both arms of a chromosome and/or re-
           places more than one segment in a chromosome, the abbreviation der is used (see Section 5.5.3).
           i.    46,XX,der(5)add(5)(p15.3)add(5)(q23)
                 or
                 46,XX,der(5)(?::p15.3→q23::?)
                 Karyotype shows additional material of unknown origin attached at band 5p15.3 in the short arm and replacing the
                 segment 5p15.3 to 5pter. There is also additional material at band 5q23 that replaces the segment 5q23 to 5qter in
                 the long arm.
        d. The abbreviation, add, applies only to the terminal addition of unknown material and its use is not
           appropriate for insertions. The abbreviation ins is used to describe unknown material inserted into
           a chromosome arm and the question mark (?) is used to describe the unknown segment (see Sec-
           tion 5.5.9).
           i.    46,XX,der(5)ins(5;?)(q13;?)
                 or
                 46,XX,der(5)(pter →q13::?::q13→qter)
                 Karyotype shows insertion of material of unknown origin into the long arm of chromosome 5 at band 5q13. For
                 this example der is used as the abbreviation add would imply that the unknown material has replaced 5q13 to 5qter



5.5.2      Deletions

        a. The abbreviation del is used to denote both terminal and interstitial deletions. A deletion is a loss
           of a chromosome segment, the extent of which is apparent from the description of the breakpoints.
           Note: designations such as 5q– or del(5q), that may be useful abbreviations in the text, must not be
           used in the ISCN description (see Section 5.1).
        b. With an interstitial deletion where the two breaks occur within the same arm, the breakpoints are
           specified from pter to qter. Terminal deletions are reported using a single breakpoint.
           i.    46,XX,del(5)(q13)
                 or
                 46,XX,del(5)(pter →q13:)
                 Karyotype shows a terminal deletion with a break (:) in band 5q13. The remaining chromosome consists of the
                 entire short arm of chromosome 5 and the part of the long arm between the centromere and band 5q13. Note: the
                 number of metaphases must be given if this is a neoplastic sample.

             ii.   46,XX,del(4)(p15.2)
                   or
                   46,XX,del(4)(:p15.2→qter)
                   Karyotype shows a terminal deletion with a break (:) in band 4p15.2. The remaining chromosome consists of the
                   part of the short arm of chromosome 4 between band 4p15.2 to the centromere, and then to the end of the entire
                   long arm.

             iii. 46,XX,del(5)(q13q33)[20]
                  or
                  46,XX,del(5)(pter →q13::q33→qter)[20]
                   Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 5 involving the segment 5q13 to 5q33.
                   The detailed system (karyotype format) shows breakage and reunion (::) of 5q13 and 5q33.

             iv. 46,XX,del(5)(q13q13)
                 or
                 46,XX,del(5)(pter →q13::q13→qter)
                   Karyotype shows an interstitial deletion of a small segment within band 5q13, i.e., both breakpoints are in band
                   5q13.

             v.    46,XY,del(5)(q?)[20]
                   Karyotype shows deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 in a neoplastic sample, but it is unclear whether it is a
                   terminal or an interstitial deletion, and the breakpoints are unknown.

             vi. 46,Y,del(X)(p21p11.4)
                   Karyotype shows interstitial deletion of the segment between bands Xp21 and Xp11.4.

             vii. 46,XY,del(20)(q11.2–13.1q13.3)
                   Karyotype at 300 band resolution shows an interstitial deletion with the proximal breakpoint in band 20q11.2–13.1
                   and distal breakpoint at 20q13.3. Note: metaphase numbers are given if this is a neoplastic sample.

        c. Multiple deletions of the same chromosome are expressed using the abbreviation der (see Section
           5.5.3).


5.5.3        Derivative Chromosomes

        a. A derivative chromosome (der) is a structurally rearranged chromosome generated either by a re-
           arrangement involving two or more chromosomes or by multiple aberrations within a single chro-
           mosome. The abbreviation always refers to chromosome(s) with the intact centromere.
        b. A derivative chromosome generated by more than one rearrangement within a chromosome is
           specified in parentheses (()), followed by the ISCN description of the abnormality. The rearrange-
           ments are given according to the breakpoints of the derivative chromosome from pter to qter.
        c. The detailed system (karyotype format) is more informative in the following examples.
             i.    46,XY,der(9)del(9)(p12)del(9)(q31)
                   or
                   46,XY,der(9)(:p12→q31:)
                   Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 9 resulting from terminal deletions in both the short and long arms with
                   breakpoints in bands 9p12 and 9q31.

             ii.   46,XY,der(9)inv(9)(p23p13)del(9)(q22q33)
                   or
                   46,XY,der(9)(pter →p23::p13→p23::p13→q22::q33→qter)
                   Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 9 resulting from an inversion in the short arm with breakpoints in 9p23
                   and 9p13, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm with breakpoints in 9q22 and 9q33.

                                DOI: 10.1159/000538512
d. A derivative chromosome resulting from one rearrangement involving two or more chromo-
   somes is specified in parentheses (()), followed by the description of the abnormality.
   i.    46,Y,der(X)t(X;8)(p22.3;q24.1)
         or
         46,Y,der(X)(8qter →8q24.1::Xp22.3 →Xqter)
         A male karyotype with a derivative X chromosome from a translocation between Xp22.3 and 8q24.1. Note: the
         normal sex chromosome, in this example the Y chromosome, is listed first.

   ii.   46,XX,der(1)t(1;3)(p22;q13.1)
         or
         46,XX,der(1)(3qter →3q13.1::1p22→1qter)
         Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 1 from a translocation of the chromosome 3 segment 3q13.1 to 3qter
         to the short arm of chromosome 1 at band 1p22. This results in an unbalanced karyotype with loss of the segment
         1pter to 1p22 and gain of 3q13.1 to 3qter. The der(1) replaces a normal chromosome 1 and there is no need to in-
         dicate the missing chromosome (see Section 5.4.1). There are two normal chromosomes 3.

   iii. 45,XY,der(1)t(1;3)(p22;q13.1),–3
         The derivative chromosome 1 (same as above) replaces a normal chromosome 1, but there is only one normal chro-
         mosome 3, hence –3 is given in the ISCN description. The der(3) resulting from the t(1;3) is presumed to be lost,
         but this assumption is not stated in the karyotype.

   iv. 47,XY,+der(4)t(4;11)(q21;q23),t(4;11)[10]
         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 4 and 11.
         There is an additional copy of the derivative chromosome 4 from this translocation. The additional derivative chro-
         mosome 4 is listed before the translocation following the chromosome order rule (see Section 4.3). Note: the break-
         points do not need to be repeated because the chromosome abnormalities are generated by the same rearrangement
         (see Sections 4.2.1, 5.1 and 5.6).

   v.    46,XY,der(3)ins(16;3)(p12;p21p13)dmat
         Karyotype shows a derivative 3 from a balanced maternal insertion of bands 3p21p13 into chromosome 16 at band
         16p12. There is one normal chromosome 3. The net imbalance in the proband is a loss of region 3p21p13. Note:
         correlation and interpretation of the clinical history must be made and the ISCN description written in accordance
         with known parental rearrangements. Therefore, 46,XY,del(3)(p21p13)dmat should not be used.
e. The term Philadelphia chromosome is a historical description of the derivative chromosome 22
   generated by the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). The abbreviation Ph (formerly Ph1) may be used
   in text, but not in the ISCN description, where der(22)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) must be given. Similarly,
   the derivative chromosome 9 resulting from the t(9;22) is designated der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2).
f. A derivative chromosome generated by more than one rearrangement involving two or more
   chromosomes is specified in parentheses (()), followed by all aberrations involved in the genera-
   tion of the derivative chromosome. The aberrations are listed from pter to qter of the derivative
   chromosome according to the rules governing the order of chromosome anomalies (see Section 4.3)
   and are not separated by commas (,).
   i.    46,XX,der(1)t(1;3)(p32;q21)t(1;11)(q25;q13)
         or
         46,XX,der(1)(3qter →3q21::1p32→1q25::11q13→11qter)
         Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 1 generated by two unbalanced translocations. One unbalanced trans-
         location between chromosome 1 at 1p32 and chromosome 3 at 3q21, and a second unbalanced translocation between
         the same chromosome 1 at 1q25 and chromosome 11 at 11q13.

   ii.   46,XY,der(1)t(1;3)(p32;q21)t(3;7)(q28;q11.2)
         or
         46,XY,der(1)(7qter→7q11.2::3q28→3q21::1p32→1qter)
         Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 1 resulting from an unbalanced translocation between chromosome 1
         at 1p32 and chromosome 3 at 3q21, and an unbalanced translocation between chromosome 3 at 3q28 and chromo-
         some 7 at 7q11.2. The detailed system (karyotype format) describes the derivative chromosome 1 from 7qter to
         1qter as the aberrations are listed from pter to qter, according to the orientation of the segment that contains the
         centromere (see Sections 4.3 and 5.4.2.2).

          Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 1 resulting from an unbalanced translocation between chromosome 1
          at 1p32 and chromosome 3 at 3q21; there is also duplication of the chromosome 1 long arm segment from 1q25 to

          Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 9 generated by a terminal short arm deletion with the breakpoint at 9p12,
          and by an unbalanced translocation with chromosome 13 at 13q11 and the long arm of the same chromo-
          some 9 at 9q34.

          Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 1 generated by two unbalanced translocations. One unbalanced trans-
          location between chromosome 1 at 1p32 and chromosome 11 at 11q13, and a second unbalanced translocation be-
          tween the same chromosome 1 at 1q25 and chromosome 3 at 3q21. Note: the detailed system (karyotype format)
          describes the derivative chromosome 1 from 11qter to 3qter as the aberrations are listed according to the orientation
          of the segment that contains the centromere, from pter to qter (see Sections 4.3 and 5.4.2.2).

          Karyotype shows a supernumerary ring chromosome determined to be a derivative chromosome 8 as it has the
          chromosome 8 centromere. The ring is generated by breakage and joining of the chromosome 1 segment from
          1p36.3 to 1p32 to the chromosome 8 segment from 8p23 to 8q13 that is then joined to the chromosome 17 segment
          from 17q12 to 17q25. For additional examples of ring chromosomes, see Section 5.5.16. Note: for ring chromo-
          somes, the chromosome that provides the centromere is listed first (see Section 5.5.16.2).

          Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 1 resulting from insertion of chromosome 17 from 17q25 to 17q11.2
          between chromosome 1 bands 1p34 and 1p22. There is a deletion of 1p34 to 1p22. In such situations, when there
          are two breakpoints in the recipient chromosome, the breakpoint closest to pter is listed as the point of insertion.
          The orientation of the inserted segment relative to pter and qter of the derivative chromosome is reversed in its
          new position.

           46,XY,der(7)(7pter →7q22::?::2q21→2qter)
          Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 7 in which material of unknown origin has replaced the segment 7q22
          to 7qter, and the segment 2q21 to 2qter from the long arm of chromosome 2 is attached to unidentified chromo-
          somal material. The breakpoint in the derivative chromosome is specified as the point of insertion of the unknown
          material. Note: as the breakpoint on the chromosome 7 is the same, 7q22, for the insertion and the translocation,
          the abnormalities are given in alphabetical order, i.e., ins before t (see Section 5.1).

     ix. 47,XX,t(6;9;22)(p21;q34;q11.2),+der(22)t(6;9;22)[15]
          Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a three-way translocation between chromosomes 6, 9, and 22 with an ad-
          ditional derivative chromosome 22 from this three-way translocation (see Section 4.2.1). The derivative chromo-
          some refers to the rearrangement from which it is derived, in this example it is t(6;9;22). Note: the derivative 22 is
          not described as a der(22)t(9;22) as this would imply there is a second different translocation.

         A female karyotype with a derivative chromosome 8 resulting from two translocations and a pericentric inversion.
         One translocation involves the short arm of chromosome 8 with a breakpoint at 8p23 and the long arm of chromo-
         some 17 at 17q21. The other translocation involves the long arm of chromosome 8 with a breakpoint at 8q22 and
         the long arm of chromosome 22 at 22q12. The pericentric inversion has breakpoints at 8p22 and 8q13. As the de-
         rivative 8 has no 8p telomere to follow the pter to qter description rule, the pter region of the derivative chromo-
         some replacing the normal 8p is described first. In this example, the normal 8pter region is replaced by the 17qter
         region due to the t(8;17) translocation.

       der(11)(5pter→5p10::11p10→11qter)
         Karyotype with two different balanced translocations involving the same chromosome 5 homologue: a whole-arm
         translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 5 and 11 and one translocation between the long arms of the
         same chromosome 5 and chromosome 8. Note: the abnormal chromosome 5 is involved in two rearrangements,
         therefore it is designated as a derivative chromosome. The other derivative chromosomes (der(8) and der(11)) are
         also included in the ISCN description as the rearrangement is balanced.

g. An isoderivative chromosome, abbreviated to ider, designates an isochromosome formation for
   one of the arms of a derivative chromosome. The breakpoints are assigned to the centromeric bands
   p10 and q10 according to the morphology of the isoderivative chromosome (see Section 5.5.11).

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows an isochromosome for the short arm of a derivative chromosome 9 result-
         ing from an insertion of the segment 12q13 to 12q22 at band 9p13. Band 12q22 is closer than band 12q13 to 9pter

h. When a derivative chromosome is dicentric and contains one or more additional abnormalities, the
   two centromere containing chromosomes are given within parentheses (()), separated by a semico-
   lon (;), followed by the specification of the aberrations.

         45,XX,der(5;7)(5pter →5q22::7p13→7q21::3q21→3qter)
         Karyotype shows a dicentric derivative chromosome with centromeres from chromosomes 5 and 7. Breakage and
         reunion occurs at band 5q22 in the long arm of chromosome 5 and at band 7p13 in the short arm of chromosome
         7. In addition, the segment 3q21 to 3qter is translocated onto the long arm of chromosome 7 at band 7q21. Note:
         in the detailed system (karyotype format) the terminal end of a chromosome arm may be designated using the ab-
         breviation ter preceded by the arm designation, i.e., 3qter instead of 3q29 in this example (see also example ii be-
         low).

         Karyotype shows a dicentric derivative chromosome with centromeres of chromosomes 5 and 7. An acentric chro-
         mosome 3 segment (3q21→3q29) is inserted between the long arm of chromosome 5 and the short arm of chromo-
         some 7. Note: when the terminal band of a chromosome is involved in a breakpoint and the end of that chromosome
         is not the end of the derivative chromosome, then the band designation should be used, e.g., 3q29 in this example.

           Karyotype with a derivative chromosome composed of the long arms of chromosome 8 with material from chromo-
           some 9 translocated to one arm of chromosome 8 at 8q24.1. There is a deletion at 8q22 to 8qter in the other long
           arm. There are two normal chromosomes 9.

i.   When the centromere of the derivative chromosome is not known, but more distal parts of the chro-
     mosome can be recognized, the abnormal chromosome may be designated der(?) (see Section
     4.2.1). Where the chromosome containing the centromere is known then that chromosome is de-
     scribed first (see example iv).

           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a derivative chromosome of unknown origin. The segment of chromosome
           9 distal to band 9p13 translocated onto a centric segment of unknown origin, and 7q11.2 to 7q32 is translocated
           onto the other end of this centric segment. There is also additional material of unknown origin joined to 7q32 on
           the derivative chromosome.

           9 distal to band 9p13 translocated onto a centric segment of unknown origin and a homogeneously staining region
           (hsr) is present on the other end of the centric segment.

           Karyotype in a neoplastic sample shows a derivative chromosome 8 with an insertion of unknown material in 8p22
           and an unbalanced translocation between chromosome 8 at 8q24 and chromosome 9 at 9q22. The chromosome 8
           segment (8p22 to 8q24) has the centromere.

j. Derivative chromosomes whose centromeres are unknown should be placed after all identified ab-
   normalities but before unidentified ring chromosomes (r), marker chromosomes (mar) and dou-
   ble minutes (dmin) (see Section 4.3), e.g., 50,XX,+X,+der(?)t(?;9)(?;q22),+r,+mar,>20dmin[20]
k. There is usually no need to indicate which homologue is involved in a derivative chromosome be-
   cause this will be apparent from the karyotype description. If both homologues are involved, this
   will result in two derivative homologous chromosomes.
l. When homologous chromosomes cannot be distinguished within the ISCN description, one of the
   numerals may be underlined (_). This may be helpful when the two homologous chromosomes are
   involved in identical aberrations resulting in two identical derivative chromosomes (see Section
   4.4.2).

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows two derivative chromosomes 9. One der(9) has a terminal deletion of the
         short arm and a translocation with chromosome 22 involving 9q34 and 22q11.2. The other der(9) has a transloca-
         tion between 9p13 and 12q22, and a paracentric inversion in the long arm of chromosome 9. There are two normal

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows the two chromosome 1 homologues involved in apparently identical trans-
         locations in different metaphases. The two abnormalities represent two different cell lines; the homologous chro-
         mosomes 1 in each cell line are normal. The two homologous chromosomes 1 are identified as being different by
         C-banding.

   iv. 46,XX,der(1)t(1;1)(p31;q32)
         In this unbalanced translocation between both chromosome 1 homologues, underlining can be used to distinguish
         between the two different derivatives. The detailed system (karyotype format) is recommended for a clearer descrip-
         tion of the rearrangement (see examples iv and v below that clarify the two different derivatives from the balanced
         translocation where the homologue without the centromere is underlined).

         Same translocation as above in which the underlined homologue has a break at 1q32. In this example the der(1) is
         not underlined. The underlined homologue does not have the centromeric segment, i.e., has the breakpoint at 1p31.
         Note: the chromosome number is given in the detailed system (karyotype format) to show that both homologues
         are involved.

         The derivative chromosome 1 is not underlined in this example and represents the homologue with a breakpoint in
         1p31. The underlined homologue does not have the centromeric segment, i.e., has the breakpoint at 1q32. Note: the
         chromosome number is given in the detailed system (karyotype format) to show that both homologues are involved.

m. Complex rearrangements may give rise to several derivative chromosomes. The breakpoints in the
   derivative chromosomes generated by the same rearrangement need not be repeated in the descrip-
   tion of each individual derivative chromosome.

         derivative chromosome 22 derived from a t(9;22). There are also two normal copies of chromosome 22, hence the
         +22 in the ISCN description. Note: the breakpoints in the short system (karyotype format) do not need to be re-
         peated for the derivative chromosome 22 as they were given in the description of the t(9;22) (see Section 4.2.1).

        n. Complex karyotypes involving rearrangements between two or more derivative chromosomes, or
           where derivative chromosomes are involved in new rearrangements the detailed system (karyotype
           format) is preferred. It is acceptable to combine the short system (karyotype format) (see Section
           5.4.2.1) and the detailed system (karyotype format) (see Section 5.4.2.2) for designating complex
           karyotypes.


5.5.4        Dicentric Chromosomes

        a. The dicentric (dic) chromosome replaces two normal chromosomes. A dicentric chromosome is
           counted as one chromosome, with the chromosome count becoming 45. There is no need to indicate
           the missing chromosome(s) (cf., whole-arm and Robertsonian translocations, Sections 5.5.18.2 and
           5.5.18.3 respectively). Two breakpoints are specified, and the centromeres are presumed to be de-
           rived from the two chromosomes involved.
        b. Isodicentric chromosomes (idic), involve a single breakpoint on sister chromatids and a subsequent
           reunion, and the chromosome count is unchanged as the idic chromosome replaces one of the nor-
           mal homologues.
        c. In rearrangements involving different chromosomes, the chromosomes are listed in chromosome
           order, i.e., the sex chromosomes (X before Y) followed by the autosomes in numerical order.
        d. For isodicentrics that derive from a single chromosome, there is no need to repeat the chromosome
           number in the detailed system (karyotype format) (see Sections 4.4.4 and 5.4.2.2).
        e. Where a dicentric or tricentric derivative chromosome has no short arm segment, the description
           starts at the end of the lowest chromosome number.
        f. The term der may be used instead of dic, but the combination of der dic should never be used.

                   Karyotype shows breakage and reunion at bands 13q14 and 13q32 on the two homologous chromosomes 13 to form
                   a dicentric chromosome. There is no normal chromosome 13. Note: the pter to qter rule applies and the chromo-
                   some number is given before pter and the breakpoint in the ISCN description as different chromosome 13 homo-
                   logues are involved.

                   45,XX,dic(13;15)(13pter →13q22::15q24→15pter)
                   Karyotype shows a dicentric chromosome with breakage and reunion at bands 13q22 and 15q24. The missing chro-
                   mosomes 13 and 15 are not indicated since they are replaced by the dicentric chromosome. The karyotype contains
                   one normal chromosome 13, one normal chromosome 15, and the dic(13;15). The resulting net imbalance of this
                   abnormality is loss of the segments distal to 13q22 and 15q24.

                   Karyotype shows a dicentric chromosome with breakage and reunion at bands 13q22 and 15q24 (same as above
                   example) that replaces one chromosome 13 and one chromosome 15. There are two normal chromosomes 13, one
                   normal chromosome 15 and the dic(13;15). The resulting net imbalance is partial trisomy for the segment 13pter
                   to 13q22 and loss of the segment 15q24 to 15qter.

             iv. 45,XY,dic(14;21)(p11.2;p11.2)
                 or
                 45,XY,dic(14;21)(14qter →14p11.2::21p11.2→21qter)
                   Karyotype shows a dicentric chromosome with breakage and reunion at bands 14p11.2 and 21p11.2. The missing
                   chromosomes 14 and 21 are not indicated since they are replaced by the dicentric chromosome. The karyotype
                   contains one normal chromosome 14, one normal chromosome 21, and the dic(14;21). The resulting net imbalance
                   of this abnormality is loss of the segments distal to 14p11.2 and 21p11.2. For description of Robertsonian translo-
                   cations, see Section 5.5.18.3.

         or
         47,XY,+dic(17;?)(17pter →17q22::?)
         Karyotype shows a supernumerary dicentric chromosome composed of one chromosome 17 with a break at band
         17q22 and an unknown chromosome with an intact centromere.

   vi. 46,X,idic(Y)(q12)
       or
       46,X,idic(Y)(pter →q12::q12→pter)
         Karyotype shows breakage and reunion at band Yq12 on sister chromatids to form an isodicentric Y chromosome.
         The resulting net imbalance is loss of the segment Yq12 to Yqter and gain of Ypter to Yq12.

        or
        46,XX,idic(21)(pter →q22.3::q22.3→pter)
         Karyotype shows breakage and reunion at band 21q22.3 on sister chromatids to form an isodicentric chromosome
         21, and one normal chromosome 21, indicated by the 46 count. Even though there are effectively three copies of
         the chromosome 21 long arm, the normal chromosome 21 is not designated with a plus (+) sign.

   viii. 47,XX,+idic(13)(q22)
         or
         47,XX,+idic(13)(pter →q22::q22→pter)
         Karyotype shows a supernumerary isodicentric chromosome 13. There are two chromosomes 13 plus the idic(13).

   ix. 47,XY,+dic(15;15)(q12;q12)
       or
       47,XY,+dic(15;15)(15pter→15q12::15q12→15pter)
         Karyotype shows a supernumerary apparently dicentric chromosome 15. There are two chromosomes 15 and a di-
         centric chromosome 15. This rearrangement has historically been referred to as inv dup(15)(q12) and usually results
         from recombination between homologues, hence dic(15;15)(q12;q12)(or psu dic, see below) is a more appropriate
         designation. Where a mechanism based on the fusion between two sister chromatids is proven, the abbreviation idic
         may be used: 47,XY,+idic(15)(q12) or 47,XY,+idic(15)(pter→q12::q12→pter). Note: the chromosome number is
         given before pter and the breakpoint in the ISCN description as different chromosome 15 homologues are involved.

g. Complex dicentric chromosomes must be described as derivative chromosomes, see Section 5.5.3.
h. A pseudodicentric chromosome is a dicentric structure in which only one centromere is active.
   Such chromosomes use the abbreviation psu dic (similarly, pseudotricentric, psu trc, etc.), and
   the segment with the presumptively active centromere, based on the morphology in the majority of
   metaphases, is always written first. If the active centromere cannot be determined, the lowest chro-
   mosome number is written first.
   i.    45,XX,psu dic(15;13)(q12;q12)
         or
         45,XX,psu dic(15;13)(15pter →15q12::13q12→13pter)
         Karyotype shows one chromosome 13 and one chromosome 15 are replaced with a pseudodicentric chromosome.
         The karyotype contains one normal chromosome 13, one normal chromosome 15, and the psu dic(15;13). The cen-
         tromere of the chromosome stated first, i.e., chromosome 15, is the active one. Note: if the active centromere is not
         known the ISCN description would be 45,XX,psu dic(13;15)(q12;q12)

   ii.   46,XX,psu idic(20)(q11.2)
         or
         46,XX,psu idic(20)(pter →q11.2::q11.2→pter)
         Karyotype shows one chromosome 20 is replaced with a pseudoisodicentric chromosome, resulting in three copies
         of 20pter to 20q11.2. The psu idic(20) has one active centromere.

5.5.5        Duplications

        a. Duplications (dup) are a gain of a chromosome segment at the original chromosome location, i.e.,
           in tandem. When a gain of a chromosome segment is found elsewhere in the genome, der or ins is
           used depending on the type of rearrangement. The orientation of the duplicated segment is indicat-
           ed by the order of the bands from pter to qter. Note: no arrow is used in the short system (karyotype
           format) to indicate the orientation.
             i.    46,XX,dup(1)(p34p31)
                   or
                   46,XX,dup(1)(pter→p31::p34→qter)
                   Karyotype shows duplication of the segment between bands 1p34 and 1p31 with no change in orientation.

             ii.   46,XX,dup(1)(p31p34)
                   or
                   46,XX,dup(1)(pter→p31::p31→p34::p31→qter) or dup(1)(pter→p34::p31→p34::p34→qter)
                   Karyotype shows duplication of the segment between bands 1p34 and 1p31 with reverse orientation of the dupli-
                   cated segment. Note: only the detailed (karyotype format) will clarify the location of the duplicated segment.

             iii. 46,XX,dup(1)(q22q25)
                  or
                  46,XX,dup(1)(pter →q25::q22→qter)
                   Karyotype shows duplication of the segment between bands 1q22 and 1q25 with no change in orientation.

                   Karyotype shows duplication of the segment between bands 1q22 and 1q25 with reverse orientation of the dupli-
                   cated segment. Note: only the detailed system (karyotype format) will clarify the location of the duplicated segment.




5.5.6        Fission

        a. The abbreviation fis is used to denote centric fission.
             i.    47,XY,–10,+fis(10)(p10),+fis(10)(q10)
                   or
                   47,XY,–10,+fis(10)(pter →p10:),+fis(10)(:q10 →qter)
                   Karyotype shows a break in the centromere of chromosome 10 resulting in two derivative chromosomes composed
                   of the short and long arms, respectively. The breakpoints (:) are assigned to 10p10 and 10q10 according to the
                   morphology of the derivative chromosomes.



5.5.7        Fragile Sites

        a. Fragile sites (fra) may occur as normal variants (see Section 2.6.2), however for those associated
           with specific diseases and/or phenotypic abnormalities, the following nomenclature is used.
             i.    46,X,fra(X)(q27.3)
                   Karyotype shows a fragile site in subband Xq27.3 on one X chromosome in a female.

           iv. 47,XY,fra(X)(q27.3)
                 Karyotype shows a fragile site in subband Xq27.3 on one X chromosome in an individual with Klinefelter syndrome.

           v.    46,XX,fra(11)(q23)
                 Karyotype shows a fragile site in band 11q23 on one chromosome 11.



5.5.8      Homogeneously Staining Regions

        a. The abbreviation hsr is used to describe the presence, but not the size, of a homogeneously stain-
           ing region in a chromosome arm, segment, or band.
        b. hsr are frequently associated with gene amplification in a variety of neoplasms and therefore the
           numbers of metaphases are given in the ISCN description.
           i.    46,XX,hsr(1)(p22)[10]
                 or
                 46,XX,hsr(1)(pter→p22::hsr::p22→qter)[10]
                 Karyotype shows a homogeneously staining region in band 1p22 in a neoplastic sample.

           ii.   46,XY,hsr(21)(q22)[10]
                 or
                 46,XY,hsr(21)(pter→q22::hsr::q22→qter)[10]
                 Karyotype shows a homogeneously staining region in band 21q22 in a neoplastic sample.

        c. When a chromosome contains multiple hsr(s) or one hsr and another structural change, it is by
           definition a derivative chromosome and should be designated accordingly (see Section 5.5.3).
           i.    46,XX,der(1)hsr(1)(p22)hsr(1)(q31)[10]
                 or
                 46,XX,der(1)(pter→p22::hsr::p22→q31::hsr::q31→qter)[10]
                 Karyotype shows two homogeneously staining regions in chromosome 1: one in band 1p22 in the short arm and
                 the other in band 1q31 in the long arm in a neoplastic sample.

        d. When an hsr is associated with a deletion, the breakpoint is assigned to the band closest to the telo-
           mere of the short arm.
           i.    46,XY,der(1)del(1)(p33p21)hsr(1)(p33)[10]
                 or
                 46,XY,der(1)(pter→p33::hsr::p21→qter)[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample where the segment between bands 1p33 and 1p21 is replaced by a homogeneous-
                 ly staining region that may be smaller or larger than the deleted segment.

           ii.   46,XX,der(2)del(2)(q21q31)hsr(2)(q21)[10]
                 or
                 46,XX,der(2)(pter→q21::hsr::q31→qter)[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample where the segment between bands 2q21 and 2q31 is replaced by a homogeneous-
                 ly staining region.

        e. When a homogeneously staining region is located at the interface between segments of different
           chromosomes involved in a rearrangement, the hsr is assigned to the breakpoints in both chromo-
           somes according to the ISCN description for structural chromosome aberrations, i.e., the two chro-
           mosomes involved are presented in the first parentheses and the breakpoints in the second.
           i.    46,XX,der(1)ins(1;7)(q21;p21p11.2)hsr(1;7)(q21;p11.2)[10]
                 or
                 46,XX,der(1)(1pter→1q21::7p21→7p11.2::hsr::1q21→1qter)[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows an insertion of the segment 7p21 to 7p11.2 in original orientation into the
                 long arm of chromosome 1 at band 1q21. The derivative chromosome also contains an hsr at the interface between
                 the recipient and donor chromosomes. The hsr is located distal to the segment inserted from chromosome 7.

                     or
                     46,XX,der(1)(1pter→1q21::hsr::7p11.2→7p21::1q21→1qter)[10]
                     Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows an insertion of the segment 7p21p11.2 in reverse orientation into the long
                     arm of chromosome 1 with breakage and reunion at band 1q21. The derivative chromosome also contains an hsr
                     at the interface between the recipient and donor chromosomes. The hsr is located proximal to the segment inserted
                     from chromosome 7.



5.5.9          Insertions

          a. Insertions are three-break rearrangements in which part of one chromosome is inserted at a point of
             breakage in the same, or another chromosome.
          b. An insertion (ins) is described with the recipient chromosome given first, followed by the inserted
             segment. The orientation of the inserted segment is indicated by the order of the bands of the in-
             serted segment from pter to qter of the recipient chromosome. For clarity, the use of the detailed
             system (karyotype format) may be used.


5.5.9.1        Insertions within a Chromosome

          a. When an insertion (ins) within a single chromosome occurs, the breakpoint at which the chromo-
             some segment is inserted is specified first. The remaining breakpoints are specified in the same way
             as in a two-break rearrangement, i.e., the breakpoint of the inserted segment that is closest to pter
             is listed first.
               i.    46,XX,ins(2)(p13q31q21)
                     or
                     46,XX,ins(2)(pter→p13::q31→q21::p13→q21::q31→qter)
                     Karyotype shows the long arm segment between bands 2q21 and 2q31.is inserted into the short arm at band 2p13.
                     The original orientation of the inserted segment relative to pter and qter is reversed in its new position, i.e., band
                     2q31 is now closer to 2pter than band 2q21

               ii.   46,XY,ins(2)(p13q21q31)
                     or
                     46,XY,ins(2)(pter→p13::q21→q31::p13→q21::q31→qter)
                     The insertion is the same as in the previous example except that the orientation of the bands within the segment is
                     maintained relative to pter and qter, i.e., band 2q21 of the inserted segment remains closer to 2pter than band 2q31



5.5.9.2        Insertions between Two Chromosomes


          a. Interchromosomal insertions (ins) are three-break rearrangements in which part of one chromosome
             is inserted at a point of breakage in the same or another chromosome. The recipient chromosome
             is specified first, regardless of whether it is a sex chromosome or an autosome with a number high-
             er or lower than that of the donor chromosome. The donor chromosome is listed last, even if it is a
             sex chromosome.
          b. The remaining breakpoints are specified in the same way as in a two-break rearrangement, i.e., the
             breakpoint of the inserted segment that is closest to the pter of the recipient chromosome is listed
             first.

                   Karyotype shows an insertion of the segment Xq21 to Xq25 into the short arm of chromosome 5 at 5p14. It is ap-
                   parent from the order of the breakpoints that the segment is inserted in the original orientation, pter to qter (see
                   Section 5.5.9). The recipient chromosome is listed first.

                   Karyotype shows an insertion of the segment 2q22 to 2q32 into the short arm of chromosome 5 at 5p14. The orig-
                   inal orientation of the inserted segment relative to pter and qter is reversed in its new position, i.e., 2q32 is now
                   closer to pter of the recipient chromosome than 2q22. Note: the recipient chromosome is specified first.

                   Karyotype shows breakage and reunion at the same bands as in the previous example except that band 2q22 remains
                   closer than band 2q32 to the pter of the recipient chromosome.

                   Karyotype shows an insertion of bands 2p23 to 2p13 from chromosome 2 into band 5q31 with reversal of orienta-
                   tion relative to the terminal short arm of the recipient chromosome 5.

             v.    46,XX,ins(5;2)(q31;p23p13)
                   or
                   46,XX,ins(5;2)(5pter→5q31::2p23→2p13::5q31→5qter;2pter→2p23::2p13→2qter)
                   Karyotype shows an insertion of bands 2p23 to 2p13 from chromosome 2 into band 5q31 in a conserved orientation
                   relative to pter of the recipient chromosome 5.

             vi. 46,XY,der(5)ins(5;2)(q31;p23p13)dmat
                   Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome 5 resulting from malsegregation of a balanced maternal insertion. There
                   is one derivative chromosome 5 containing the insertion of material from chromosome 2, one normal chromosome
                   5, and two normal chromosomes 2. Note: although inherited from the mother who has a balanced interchromo-
                   somal insertion, the rearranged chromosome is not the result of a meiotic crossing-over but from malsegregation
                   of the maternal insertion, and the abbreviation der is used instead of rec (see Section 5.5.3).

             vii. 46,X,der(X)ins(X;7)(p21;q22q21)
                   Karyotype shows a derivative X chromosome resulting from an insertion of the segment from 7q21 to 7q22 into
                   band Xp21, with band 7q22 closer to Xpter than band 7q21. There are two normal chromosomes 7.



5.5.9.3      Complex Insertions


          a. Where more than two chromosomes are involved in a complex reciprocal insertional event, the chro-
             mosome listed first is the chromosome that is the sex chromosome or the autosome with the lowest
             number, the chromosome that is listed next receives a segment from the first chromosome, and the
             chromosome specified last donates a segment to the first listed chromosome.
             i.    46,XY,ins(5;6)(q13q23;q15q23)
                   or
                   46,XY,ins(5;6)(5pter→5q13::6q15→6q23::5q23→5qter;6pter→6q15::5q13→5q23::6q23→ 6qter)
                   Karyotype shows a balanced four-break reciprocal insertion involving two chromosomes. The segment between
                   bands 5q13 and 5q23 in chromosome 5 is inserted into chromosome 6 between 6q15 and 6q23, and the chromo-
                   some 6 segment between bands 6q15 and 6q23 is inserted into chromosome 5 between 5q13 and 5q23.

                    14qter;9pter→9p23::14q24→14q21::9p12→9qter)
                    Karyotype shows a balanced six-break rearrangement with insertion of three interstitial segments. The segment
                    between bands 5q13 and 5q23 on chromosome 5 replaces the segment between bands 14q21 and 14q24 on chromo-
                    some 14, the segment 14q21 to 14q24 replaces the segment between bands 9p12 and 9p23 on chromosome 9, and
                    the segment 9p12 to 9p23 replaces the segment 5q13 to 5q23. The orientations of the segments in relation to the
                    centromere are apparent from the order of the bands. The segment 14q21 to 14q24 is inverted.




5.5.10        Inversions

         a. The abbreviation inv is used. Whether it is a paracentric or pericentric inversion is apparent from
            the band designations. In all cases, the breakpoint closer to pter of the inverted chromosome is
            specified first.
         b. There is no semicolon between the band designations within the same chromosome.
              i.    46,XX,inv(2)(p23p13)
                    or
                    46,XX,inv(2)(pter→p23::p13→p23::p13→qter)
                    Karyotype shows a paracentric inversion involving the short arm of chromosome 2 in which breakage and reunion
                    have occurred at bands 2p23 and 2p13.

              ii.   46,XX,inv(3)(q21q26.2)

                    46,XX,inv(3)(pter→q21::q26.2→q21::q26.2→qter)
                    Karyotype shows a paracentric inversion involving the long arm of chromosome 3 in which breakage and reunion
                    have occurred at bands 3q21 and 3q26.2.

              iii. 46,XY,inv(3)(p13q21)

                   46,XY,inv(3)(pter→p13::q21→p13::q21→qter)
                    Karyotype shows a pericentric inversion in which breakage and reunion have occurred at bands 3p13 and 3q21.
                    The breakpoint in the short arm is specified first.

              iv. 46,Y,inv(X)(p21q24)
                  or
                  46,Y,inv(X)(pter→p21::q24→p21::q24→qter)
                    Karyotype shows a pericentric inversion in which breakage and reunion have occurred at bands Xp21 and Xq24.
                    The normal sex chromosome is listed before the inversion of the X chromosome. The breakpoint in the short arm
                    is specified first.



5.5.11        Isochromosomes

         a. The abbreviation i (not iso) is used for isochromosomes and idic for isodicentric chromosomes.
         b. Isochromosomes are usually formed through a centric mis-division and result in chromosome arms
            that are a mirror image of each other and genetically homozygous. See also Section 5.5.4.
         c. The breakpoints in isochromosomes are assigned to the centromeric bands p10 and q10. The iso-
            chromosome designation is inferred from the banded chromosome morphology.
         d. When it is not proven that both arms are homozygous the abbreviation der is used instead. How-
            ever, for classical isochromosomes that are proven to be true isochromosomes in most cases (e.g.,
            i(9)(p10), i(12)(p10), i(18)(p10), i(X)(q10)), the abbreviation i may be used.
         e. Complex isochromosomes, including isoderivative chromosomes, are described as derivative chro-
            mosomes, see Section 5.5.3.

                   46,XX,i(17)(qter→q10::q10→qter)
                   Karyotype shows an isochromosome for the entire long arm of one chromosome 17 and consequently the breakpoint
                   is assigned to 17q10. There is one normal chromosome 17. The shorter designation i(17q) may be used in text but
                   not in the ISCN description to describe this isochromosome.

                   46,X,i(X)(qter→q10::q10→qter)
                   Karyotype shows one normal X chromosome and an isochromosome for the long arm of one X chromosome. This
                   is unbalanced as there is a single copy of the short arm of the X chromosome and three copies of the long arm of
                   the X chromosome.

             iii. 47,XY,i(X)(q10)
                   A male karyotype showing an isochromosome of the long arm of the X chromosome in addition to normal X and
                   Y chromosomes.

                   Karyotype shows an isodicentric chromosome composed of the long arms of chromosome 17 and the short arm
                   material between the centromeres and the breakpoints in 17p11.2.

             v.    46,XX,i(21)(q10)
                   Karyotype shows an isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 21 has replaced one chromosome 21. There
                   are two copies of the long arm of chromosome 21 in the isochromosome and one normal copy of chromosome 21.
                   Even though there are effectively three copies of the long arm of chromosome 21, the normal chromosome 21 is
                   not designated with a plus (+) sign. Note: if homozygosity for the long arm of chromosome 21 is not proven, an
                   alternative description using der(21)(q10;q10) should be used (see Section 5.5.18.3).

             vi. 45,XX,–21,i(21)(q10)
                   Karyotype shows an isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 21 has replaced one chromosome 21. The
                   other chromosome 21 is lost. There are two copies of the long arm of chromosome 21 in the isochromosome and
                   no normal copies of chromosome 21.

                   some 8 in addition to two normal chromosomes 8 in a neoplastic sample.



5.5.12       Marker Chromosomes

         a. A marker chromosome (mar) is a structurally abnormal chromosome that cannot be unambigu-
            ously identified or characterized by conventional banding cytogenetics. Numerous terms are used
            in the literature to describe markers, including “supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMC)”,
            “extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESAC)”, “supernumerary ring chromosomes (SRC)”,
            and “accessory chromosomes (AC)”; see Liehr et al. (2004) for a review of these abnormalities.
         b. The mar is placed in the karyotype after all identified chromosomes, unknown derivative chromo-
            somes, rings (r) and before double minutes (dmin), see Section 4.3.
         c. In the description of a karyotype, the presence of a mar must be preceded by a plus (+) sign. No
            attempt should be made to describe the morphology or size of markers in karyotypes, i.e., min mar,
            A-size mar, acro mar, etc., should not be used. If such information is relevant, it is described in words
            in the text of the report.

d. When several different marker chromosomes are clonally present, they may be indicated by an
   Arabic number after the abbreviation mar, e.g., mar1, mar2, etc. It must be stressed that mar1, mar2
   etc., does not indicate a derivation of the marker from chromosome 1, chromosome 2, and so on.
   Order of numbering for marker chromosomes (i.e., that is mar1, mar2, mar3) is a laboratory choice,
   usually either based on frequency or on size.
e. Multiple copies of the same marker are indicated by a multiplication (×) sign after the mar desig-
   nation, e.g., mar1×2 indicates two identical copies of marker 1; mar1×3 indicates three copies of
   marker 1.
f. Multiple different marker chromosomes are indicated by the appropriate number before the mar
   abbreviation, e.g., 5mar.
     i.    47,XX,+mar
           Karyotype shows one supernumerary marker chromosome.

     ii.   47,XX,t(12;16)(q13;p11.2),+mar[10]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 16 involving 12q13 and
           16p11.2, and one supernumerary marker chromosome in ten metaphases.

     iii. 48,X,t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2),+2mar[10]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a translocation between the X chromosome and chromosome 18 involving
           Xp11.2 and 18q11.2, and two different marker chromosomes in ten metaphases.

     iv. 47,X,t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2),+mar1[5]/48,X,t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2),+mar1,+mar2[12]
           Same example as above but one marker (mar2) is not present in all the metaphases in this neoplastic sample. Note:
           the least complex clone is given first (see Section 6.3.3.1).

     v.    47∼51,XY,t(11;22)(q24;q12),+1∼5mar[cp10]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a translocation involving chromosomes 11 and 22 and five additional
           marker chromosomes, but not all metaphases contain all the markers.

     vi. 48,XX,i(17)(q10),+mar1,+mar2[17]/51,XX,i(17)(q10),+mar1×3,+mar2,+mar3[13]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows two different marker chromosomes (mar1 and mar2) in the clone with 48
           chromosomes. The clone with 51 chromosomes has three copies of mar1, one copy of mar2, and a third marker
           chromosome, mar3.

g. When any part of an abnormal chromosome can be recognized, even if the origin of the centromere
   is unknown, this abnormal chromosome is referred to as a der and not as a mar (see Section 5.5.3).
     i.    47,XX,+der(?)t(?;15)(?;q22)
           The centromere of this abnormal chromosome is unknown and hence it is designated der(?), but part of the chromo-
           some is composed of the chromosome 15 segment distal to band 15q22.

h. Double minutes (dmin) represent a special kind of acentric structure that is recorded in the karyo-
   type when present in more than one metaphase cell. Note: the dmin must not be included in the
   chromosome count, and the abbreviation is not preceded by a plus (+) sign. In the ISCN description
   the abbreviation dmin follows any centric marker. The number of dmin per cell is presented before
   the abbreviation either in absolute numbers or as a mean or a range.
i. Where there are too many copies of double minutes (dmin) to enumerate, the greater than (>) sign
   may be used to show the minimum number of copies present.
     i.    49,XX,+3mar,3dmin[10]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows three marker chromosomes and three dmin per cell.

     ii.   49,XY,+3mar,∼14dmin[15]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows three marker chromosomes and approximately 14 dmin per cell.

     iii. 49,XX,+3mar,>50dmin[8]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows three marker chromosomes and more than 50 dmin per cell.

              iv. 49,XX,+3mar,9∼>50dmin[8]
                    Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows three marker chromosomes and 9 to more than 50 dmin per cell.

         j.   Acentric fragments (ace) other than dmin, even if present in more than one cell, must not be pre-
              sented in the karyotype, and must be recorded in chromosome breakage studies (see Chapter 12).


5.5.13        Neocentromeres

         a. A neocentromere is a functional centromere that has arisen or is active within a region not known
            to have a centromere. A chromosome with a neocentromere may be described with the abbreviation
            neo or as a derivative chromosome (der) with the assumption that a new centromere has arisen (or
            is activated) within the region(s) from which the chromosome segment is derived.
         b. A supernumerary marker chromosome containing a neocentromere may require the use of the de-
            tailed (karyotype format) depending on the circumstance.
              i.    47,XX,+der(3)(:q28→qter)
                    or
                    47,XX,+neo(3)(:q28 →qter)
                    Karyotype shows a supernumerary derivative chromosome comprising the segment 3q28 to 3qter. This segment
                    does not usually include a centromere and has a neocentromere. In this example, either neo or der could be used.
                    The location of the neocentromere could be indicated by the abbreviation neo: 47,XX,+der(3)(:q28→neo →q28→
                    qter). Note: the detailed system (karyotype format) may provide more clarity in describing this chromosome.

              ii.   47,XX,der(3)(:p11→q11:),+neo(3)(pter→p11::q11→q26→neo→q26→qter)
                    Karyotype shows that chromosome 3 is replaced by a derivative small chromosome containing the chromosome 3
                    centromere and by a large chromosome composed of the remaining part of chromosome 3 where a neocentromere
                    is activated at 3q26.

              iii. 47,XX,+neo(10)(qter→q25::q25→qter)
                   or
                   47,XX,+neo(10)(qter→q25::q25→q26→neo→q26→qter)
                   or
                   47,XX,+der(10)(qter→q25::q25→q26→neo→q26→qter)
                    Karyotype shows a supernumerary chromosome that is a duplication of the segments between bands 10q25 and
                    10qter. This segment does not usually include a centromere and has a neocentromere. The location of the neocen-
                    tromere could be indicated as shown.




5.5.14        Quadruplications

         a. The abbreviation qdp is used. It is not possible to indicate the orientation(s) of the segment with the
            short system (karyotype format).
              i.    46,XX,qdp(1)(q23q32)
                    or

5.5.15        Recombinant Chromosomes

         a. A recombinant chromosome (rec) is a structurally rearranged chromosome with a new segmental
            composition resulting from meiotic crossing-over between a displaced segment and its normally
            located counterpart in certain types of structural heterozygotes, i.e., these recombinant chromosomes

              arise during gametogenesis as predictable consequences of crossing over in inversion or insertion
              heterozygotes (see Section 5.4.3.2).
           b. The abbreviation rec should not be used in the description of acquired chromosome abnormalities,
              nor those resulting from malsegregation.
           c. If parental karyotypes are unknown or a parental rearrangement has not been identified, the abnor-
              mal chromosome should be designated as a der, not rec.
           d. The recombinant chromosome is speciﬁed in parentheses immediately following the abbreviation
              rec. The chromosome designation used indicates the origin of the centromere of the specific recom-
              binant chromosome.

                      tion of the segment from 1q32 to 1qter due to a meiotic crossing-over in a parent who carries an interchromosomal
                      insertion of the segment from 5q11.2 to 5q22 into band 1q32.




5.5.16          Ring Chromosomes

           a. A ring chromosome (r), may be composed of one or several chromosomes.
              • Where the origin of the centromere is known it is given in parentheses immediately after the ab-
                 breviation r and followed by the breakpoints, e.g., 47,XX,+r(3)(p25q29)
              • Where the centromere is known and the breakpoints cannot be identified but additional studies
                 confirm chromosome origin the identity of the ring chromosome can be given in parentheses
                 immediately after the abbreviation r, e.g., 47,XX,+r(3)
              • If no part of the ring chromosome including the centromere is identified then it is given without
                 chromosome designation or breakpoints, e.g., 47,XY,+r


5.5.16.1        Ring Chromosomes Derived from One Chromosome


           a. As in other rearrangements affecting a single chromosome, there is no semicolon between the band
              designations.

                    identified at 550 band resolution with no discernable deletion of material at either breakpoint.



5.5.16.2      Ring Chromosomes Derived from More than One Chromosome


           a. Ring chromosomes derived from more than one chromosome may contain one or several centro-
              meres.
           b. Monocentric ring chromosomes are described as derivative (der) chromosomes (see Section
              5.5.3). The chromosome that provides the centromere is listed first. The order and orientation of the
              remaining segment is apparent from the order of the breakpoints.
              i.    46,XX,der(1)r(1;3)(p36.1q23;q21q27)
                    or
                    46,XX,der(1)(::1p36.1→1q23::3q21→3q27::)
                    Karyotype shows a ring chromosome composed of chromosome 1 with breakpoints in 1p36.1 and 1q23, and the
                    acentric segment between bands 3q21 and 3q27 of chromosome 3.

              ii.   46,XX,der(1)r(1;3)(p36.1q23;q27q21)
                    or
                    46,XX,der(1)(::1p36.1→1q23::3q27→3q21::)
                    Karyotype shows a ring chromosome with the same breakpoints as in the previous example, but the orientation of
                    the acentric segment of chromosome 3 is reversed.

              iii. 46,XY,der(8)r(8;2)(p21.3q24.1;q23q33)
                   or

                    Karyotype shows a ring chromosome composed of part of chromosome 8 from 8p21.3 to 8q24.1 and an acentric
                    fragment of chromosome 2 long arm from bands 2q23 to 2q33. As the chromosome 8 segment contains the centro-
                    mere, it is listed before the acentric fragment from chromosome 2.

              iv. 46,XX,der(1)r(1;?)(p36.1q23;?)
                  or
                  46,XX,der(1)(::1p36.1→1q23::?::)
                    Karyotype shows a ring chromosome composed of chromosome 1 with breakpoints in 1p36.1 and 1q23, and an
                    unknown acentric segment.
           c. If the centromere of the ring chromosome is not known, but segments from other chromosomes
              contained in the ring are recognized, the ring is designated der(?).
              i.    47,XX,+der(?)r(?;3;5)(?;q21q26.2;q13q33)
                    or

           d. Dicentric or tricentric ring chromosomes are designated by the abbreviation r preceded by the
              triplet dic or trc.
           e. In dicentric ring chromosomes (dic r), the sex chromosomes or the autosome with the lowest num-
              ber is specified first.
              i.    47,XX,+dic r(1;3)(p36.1q32;p24q26.2)
                    or

         f. In tricentric ring chromosomes (trc r), the sex chromosomes or the autosome with the lowest
            number is specified first. The orientation of the chromosomes will be apparent from the order of the
            breakpoints.
              i.    47,XX,+trc r(1;3;12)(p36.1q32;q26.3p24;p12q23)

                    Karyotype shows a tricentric ring chromosome in which 1q32 is joined to 3q26.3, 3p24 is joined to 12p12, and
                    12q23 is joined to 1p36.1.

         g. When the origin of the ring chromosome is known, the description of the ring is placed in the ap-
            propriate chromosome number order, e.g., 49,XX,+1,+3,r(7),+8
         h. When the origin of the ring chromosome is not known, the presence of the ring (r) abbreviation,
            preceded by a plus (+) sign, is indicated at the end of the karyotype, but before any other marker
            chromosome (see Section 4.3), e.g., 50,XX,+1,+3,+8,+r and 50,XX,+1,+3,+8,+r+mar
         i. Different ring chromosomes may be indicated by an Arabic number after the abbreviation r, e.g.,
            r1, r2, etc., whereas several copies of unidentified ring chromosomes are indicated by the appropri-
            ate number before the ring chromosome abbreviation, e.g., 5r. The order for numbering the different
            ring chromosomes is at the discretion of the laboratory.

                    Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with two distinctly different clonally occurring ring chromosomes. Note: the
                    designations r1 and r2 do not indicate that the derivation is from chromosomes 1 and 2. When the origin of a ring
                    chromosome is known, the appropriate chromosome is placed in parentheses, e.g., r(1), r(2), etc.

              ii.   51,XY,+5r[10]
                    Karyotype shows a neoplastic sample with a total of five ring chromosomes but it is not known if any of the rings
                    are identical.




5.5.17        Telomeric Associations

         a. The abbreviation tas is used to describe a telomeric association, which is typically a single cell
            abnormality. However, it is only reported in the ISCN description if it is a clonal abnormality.
         b. In telomeric associations between two chromosomes, the sex chromosome or the autosome with the
            lowest number is specified first.
         c. When more than two chromosomes are involved, the end chromosome that is a sex chromosome or
            has the lowest autosomal number, is specified first, followed by the other chromosomes in the order
            they are associated with the chromosome listed first.
         d. In the short system (karyotype format), the terminal bands of the chromosomes involved in telo-
            meric association(s) are given in the second parentheses; the orientation of the chromosomes will
            be apparent from the order in which the breakpoints are listed.
         e. Chromosomes involved in telomeric associations are counted as separate chromosomes, as it is not
            proven that there is true chromosome fusion with terminal breakpoints.
              i.    46,XX,tas(12;13)(q24.3;q34)
                    or

                    46,Y,tas(X;12;3)(Xpter→Xqter→12pter→12qter→3qter→3pter)
                    Karyotype shows an association between the telomeric regions of the long arm of the X chromosome and the short
                    arm of chromosome 12, and between the telomeric regions of the long arm of chromosome 12 and the long arm of
                    chromosome 3.

                      chromosome 12, and between the telomeric regions of the long arm of chromosome 12 and the short arm of chro-
                      mosome 7.



5.5.18          Translocations

5.5.18.1        Reciprocal Translocations


             a. Translocation (t) refers to the exchange of terminal segments of chromosomes. When a transloca-
                tion is balanced, there is no discernable gain or loss of chromosomal material.
             b. The sex chromosome or the autosome with the lowest number is always specified first. If both sex
                chromosomes are involved, the X chromosome is listed before the Y chromosome.
             c. To distinguish homologous chromosomes, one of the numerals may be underlined (_) (see Sec-
                tions 4.4.2 and 5.5.18.1.2).


5.5.18.1.1      Two-Break Rearrangements

                      Karyotype shows breakage and reunion at bands Xq27 and 13q12. The segments distal to these bands are exchanged.
                      Since one of the chromosomes involved in the translocation is a sex chromosome, it is designated first. Note: the
                      correct designation is 46,X,t(X;13) and not 46,XX,t(X;13). Similarly, an identical translocation in a male is desig-
                      nated 46,Y,t(X;13) and not 46,XY,t(X;13).

                iv. 46,t(X;Y)(q22;q11.23)

5.5.18.1.2        Three-Break Rearrangements


             a. For balanced translocations involving three separate chromosomes, with one breakpoint in each
                chromosome, the sex chromosome or autosome with the lowest number is specified first. The chro-
                mosome listed next receives a segment from the first chromosome, and the chromosome specified
                last donates a segment to the first listed chromosome.

                        Karyotype shows a translocation of the segment of chromosome 2 from 2p21 to 2pter onto chromosome 7 at band
                        7q22, the segment on chromosome 7 from 7q22 to 7qter is translocated onto chromosome 5 at 5q23, and the seg-
                        ment of chromosome 5 from 5q23 to 5qter is translocated onto chromosome 2 at 2p21.

                        and the segment of chromosome 18 distal to 18q11.1 is translocated to Xp11.1. The normal Y chromosome is list-
                        ed before the abnormal X chromosome.




5.5.18.1.3        Four-Break and More Complex Rearrangements


             a. The same rule as for three-break rearrangements is followed in four-break and more complex bal-
                anced translocations for order and chromosome listing.

                    Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a four-break rearrangement involving the two homologous chromosomes
                    9. The segment on chromosome 3 distal to 3p13 is translocated onto chromosome 9 at band 9q22, the segment on

                    chromosome 9 distal to 9q34 is translocated onto chromosome 22 at 22q11.2, and the segment on chromosome 22
                    distal to 22q11.2 is translocated onto chromosome 3 at 3p13.
           b. The derivative chromosomes produced by malsegregation of reciprocal translocations and inser-
              tions are described using the conventions outlined in Section 5.5.3.


5.5.18.2      Whole-Arm Translocations


           a. Whole-arm translocations are described by assigning the breakpoints to the centromeric bands p10
              for short arm and q10 for long arm according to the morphology of the abnormal chromosomes. The
              breakpoints are assigned to (p10;p10) when both short arms are joined together, and (p10;q10) when
              a short arm of one chromosome and the long arm of the second chromosome are joined together.
           b. In balanced whole-arm translocations, the breakpoint in the chromosome that is a sex chromo-
              some or the autosome with the lowest number is assigned to p10.
              i.    46,XY,t(1;3)(p10;q10)
                    or
                    46,XY,t(1;3)(1pter→1p10::3q10→3qter;3pter→3p10::1q10→1qter)
                    Karyotype shows a reciprocal whole-arm translocation in which the short arm of chromosome 1 is joined at the
                    centromere with the long arm of chromosome 3 and the long arm of chromosome 1 is joined to the short arm of
                    chromosome 3.

              ii.   46,XY,t(1;3)(p10;p10)
                    or
                    46,XY,t(1;3)(1pter→1p10::3p10→3pter;1qter→1q10::3q10→3qter)
                    Karyotype shows a reciprocal whole-arm translocation in which the short arms of chromosomes 1 and 3 and the
                    long arms of these chromosomes, respectively, are joined at the centromeres.
           c. In the description of karyotypes containing derivative chromosomes resulting from unbalanced
              whole-arm translocations (see Section 5.5.3), the derivative chromosome (der) replaces the two
              normal chromosomes involved in the translocation. The two missing normal chromosomes are not
              specified. The imbalance(s) can be inferred from the karyotype designation.
              i.    45,XX,der(1;3)(p10;q10)
                    or

                    Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome consisting of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chro-
                    mosome 3. The missing chromosomes 1 and 3 are not indicated since they are replaced by the derivative chromo-
                    some. The karyotype contains one normal chromosome 1, one normal chromosome 3, and the der(1;3). The result-
                    ing net imbalance of this abnormality is monosomy for the long arm of chromosome 1 and monosomy for the short
                    arm of chromosome 3.

                    mosome 3 (same as above) replaces one chromosome 1 and one chromosome 3. There are, however, two normal
                    chromosomes 1, i.e., an additional chromosome 1 in relation to the expected loss due to the der(1;3). Consequent-
                    ly, this gain is indicated as +1. The karyotype contains two normal chromosomes 1, one normal chromosome 3, and
                    the der(1;3). The resulting net imbalance is trisomy for 1p and monosomy for 3p.

                      mosome 3 (same as above) has replaced one chromosome 1 and one chromosome 3. There are, however, two nor-
                      mal chromosomes 3, i.e., an additional chromosome 3 in relation to the expected loss due to the der(1;3). Conse-
                      quently, this gain is indicated as +3. The karyotype contains one normal chromosome 1, two normal chromosomes
                      3, and the der(1;3). The resulting net imbalance is monosomy for 1q and trisomy for 3q.

                      Karyotype shows an extra derivative chromosome consisting of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm
                      of chromosome 3 (same as above). There are two normal chromosomes 1, two normal chromosomes 3, and the
                      der(1;3). The resulting net imbalance is trisomy for 1p and trisomy for 3q.

                v.    44,XY,–1,der(1;3)(p10;q10)
                      Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome consisting of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chro-
                      mosome 3 (same as above) has replaced one chromosome 1 and one chromosome 3. There is, however, no normal
                      chromosome 1, indicated as –1 in relation to the expected presence of one chromosome 1 due to the der(1;3). The
                      karyotype contains no chromosome 1, one normal chromosome 3, and the der(1;3). The resulting net imbalance is
                      nullisomy for 1q, monosomy for 1p, and monosomy for 3p.



5.5.18.3        Robertsonian Translocations


           a. Robertsonian translocations (rob) are constitutional whole-arm translocations of the acrocentric
              chromosomes 13, 14 ,15, 21 and 22. The breakpoints mostly occur in the short arms, resulting in
              dicentric chromosomes. Breaks may also occur in one short arm and one long arm of the participat-
              ing chromosomes, resulting in monocentric rearrangements. Usually there is simultaneous loss of
              the remaining short arms.
           b. Although either rob or der can adequately describe these whole-arm translocations, der is the pre-
              ferred designation. The abbreviation rob should not be used in the description of acquired abnor-
              malities.
                i.    45,XX,der(13;21)(q10;q10)
                      Karyotype shows that breakage and reunion have occurred at band 13q10 and band 21q10 in the centromeres of
                      chromosomes 13 and 21. The derivative chromosome has replaced one chromosome 13 and one chromosome 21
                      and there is no need to indicate the missing chromosomes. The karyotype contains one normal chromosome 13, one
                      normal chromosome 21, and the der(13;21). The resulting net imbalance is loss of the short arms of chromosomes
                      13 and 21.

                ii.   46,XX,der(13;21)(q10;q10),+21
                      Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome consisting of the long arm of chromosome 13 and the long arm of chro-
                      mosome 21 (same as above) has replaced one chromosome 13 and one chromosome 21. There are, however, two
                      normal chromosomes 21, i.e., an additional chromosome 21 in relation to the expected loss due to the der(13;21).
                      Consequently, this gain is indicated as +21. The karyotype contains one normal chromosome 13, two normal chro-
                      mosomes 21, and the der(13;21). The resulting net imbalance is loss of the short arm of chromosome 13 and tri-
                      somy for the long arm of chromosome 21.

                iii. 46,XX,+13,der(13;21)(q10;q10)
                      Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome consisting of the long arm of chromosome 13 and the long arm of chro-
                      mosome 21 (same as above) has replaced one chromosome 13 and one chromosome 21. The karyotype contains
                      two normal chromosomes 13, one normal chromosome 21, and the der(13;21). Consequently, this gain is indicated
                      as +13. The resulting net imbalance is loss of the short arm of chromosome 21 and trisomy for the long arm of
                      chromosome 13.

           c. If only a single chromosome is involved in the rearrangement, the extra chromosome is indicated
              by the 46 chromosome count in the presence of a whole-arm rearrangement and the addition of a
              normal chromosome.

                     Karyotype shows a derivative chromosome composed of the long arms of chromosome 21. There are two copies
                     of the long arm of chromosome 21 in the derivative chromosome and one normal chromosome 21, indicated by the
                     46 chromosomes count. The normal chromosome 21 is designated with a plus (+) sign. Note: for an alternative
                     description of this same rearrangement as an isochromosome if homozygosity for the long arm of the rearranged
                     chromosome is proven, see Section 5.5.11.
           d. If it is proven that the derivative chromosome resulting from a whole-arm translocation is dicentric,
              i.e., the breakpoints are assigned to p11.2 or q11.2, the abbreviation dic is used and the dicentric
              chromosome is described accordingly (see Section 5.5.4).


5.5.18.4       Jumping Translocations


           a. Jumping translocations are described with the ISCN description for translocations. The cell lines/
              clones are presented with the largest cell line/clone listed first. Cell lines/clones of equal size are
              given according to Sections 4.5.3, 5.1 and 6.3.3.2.

                     Karyotype shows three clonal translocations involving band 7q11.2. The segment 7q11.2 to 7qter is translocated to
                     bands 1p36.3, 4q35, and 9p24.

                     Karyotype shows a clonal translocation where the chromosome 13 long arm is translocated either to a chromosome

                     two copies of the long arm of chromosome 13), or on one chromosome 15 in a balanced state. Note: there is a re-
                     duction in the chromosome number when the derivative chromosome replaces one chromosome 13 and one chro-
                     mosome 15.



5.5.19         Tricentric Chromosomes

           a. A tricentric (trc) chromosome has three centromeres.
           b. In the description of a tricentric chromosome, if the sex chromosome centromere is involved, it is
              given first followed by the autosomes in numerical order. For tricentric chromosomes involving only
              autosomes, numerical order is followed (lowest to highest).
           c. The other chromosome segments are listed in the order they are attached to the chromosome listed
              first. The orientation of the chromosomes will be apparent from the order of the breakpoints speci-
              fied in the second parentheses.
           d. A tricentric chromosome is counted as one chromosome, with the normal chromosome count then
              becoming 44. There is no need to indicate the missing normal chromosomes.
               i.    44,XX,trc(4;12;9)(q31.2;q22p13;q34)
                     or
                     44,XX,trc(4;12;9)(4pter→4q31.2::12q22→12p13::9q34→9pter)
                     Karyotype shows a tricentric chromosome in which band 4q31.2 is joined to12q22 and 12p13 is joined to 9q34.




5.5.20         Triplications

           a. The abbreviation trp is used. It is not possible to indicate the orientation(s) of the segment in the
              short system (karyotype format), but this can be done with the detailed system (karyotype format).
               i.    46,XX,trp(1)(q21q32)
                     or
                     46,XX,trp(1)(pter→q32::q21→q32::q21→qter)
                     Karyotype shows triplication of the segment between bands 1q21 and 1q32, one of several possible orientations of
                     the triplications of this segment. Note: trp indicates that the three copies are tandem.

           ii.   46,XX,trp(1)(q32q21)
                 or
                 46,XX,trp(1)(pter→q32::q32→q21::q21→qter)
                 Karyotype shows triplication of the segment between bands 1q21 and 1q32 with one segment in an opposite orien-
                 tation to the above example.



5.6        Multiple Copies of Rearranged Chromosomes

      a. The multiplication (×) sign can be used to describe multiple copies of a rearranged chromosome
         but it is not used to denote multiple copies of normal chromosomes.
      b. The number of copies (×2, ×3, etc.) is placed after the abnormality.
      c. Extra copies of a rearranged chromosome, when present, do not require the breakpoints to be re-
         peated, i.e., they are specified the first time they appear in the karyotype (see also Section 4.2.1).
           i.    46,XX,del(6)(q13q23)×2[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows two chromosomes 6 with an interstitial deletion of the long arm between
                 6q13 and 6q23, and no normal chromosome 6. Since the two abnormal chromosomes replace the two normal chro-
                 mosomes, there is no need to indicate the missing normal chromosomes.

           ii.    48,XY,+del(6)(q13q23)×2[10]
                 or

                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows two apparently normal chromosomes 6 plus two additional chromosomes
                 6 with an interstitial deletion of the long arm between 6q13 and 6q23.

           iii. 47,XX,del(6)(q13q23)×2,+del(6)[15]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows three copies of chromosome 6 with an interstitial deletion of the long arm
                 between 6q13 and 6q23, and no normal chromosomes 6, i.e., two of the deleted chromosomes replace the two nor-
                 mal chromosomes 6. Note: in the ISCN description the supernumerary chromosome 6 with an interstitial deletion
                 is preceded by a plus (+) sign.

           iv. 48,XX,del(6)(q13q23)×2,+7,+7[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows two chromosomes 6 with an interstitial deletion of the long arm between
                 6q13 and 6q23. There are no normal chromosomes 6; there is gain of two chromosomes 7.

           v.    48,XX,t(8;14)(q24.1;q32),+der(14)t(8;14)×2[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a balanced translocation, t(8;14) plus two additional copies of the deriva-
                 tive chromosome 14. There is one apparently normal chromosome 8, one apparently normal chromosome 14 and
                 there are three derivative chromosomes 14 from the t(8;14).

           vi. 92,XXXX,t(8;14)(q24.1;q32)×2[10]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a tetraploid clone with two balanced translocations, t(8;14). The two de-
                 rivative chromosomes 8 and 14 replace two normal chromosomes 8 and 14. There are two normal chromosomes 8
                 and 14.

           vii. 94,XXYY,t(8;14)(q24.1;q32)×2,+der(14)t(8;14)×2[15]
                or
                94,XXYY,t(8;14)(q24.1;q32)×2,+14,+14,der(14)t(8;14)×2[15]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a hypertetraploid clone with two balanced translocations, t(8;14) plus two
                 additional copies of the derivative chromosome 14. There are two normal chromosomes 8 and 14.

           viii. 93,XXXX,t(8;14)(q24.1;q32)×2,der(14)t(8;14)×2,+der(14)t(8;14)[15]
                 Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a hypertetraploid clone with two balanced translocations, t(8;14) and three
                 extra copies of the derivative chromosome 14, i.e., there are five derivative chromosomes 14, and there is no normal
                 chromosome 14.

               Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a hypertetraploid clone with two balanced translocations, t(8;14). There
               are six copies of chromosome 14: one chromosome 14 is apparently normal and five are derivative chromosomes
               14 from the t(8;14).

               47,XX,i(8)(q10),+i(8)[10]
               Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with an alternative description of the same chromosome complement to describe
               two copies of an isochromosome for the long arm of chromosome 8 and one normal chromosome 8.

         xi. 49,XX,+1,+der(1)t(1;16)(p13;q13)×2,t(1;16)[10]
               A karyotype of a neoplastic sample with two additional copies of a derivative chromosome 1, from a translocation
               involving chromosomes 1 and 16. In this case, the numerical gain of chromosome 1 is listed first. The derivative
               chromosome 1 with the breakpoint band designation is listed before the translocation that is given without the band
               designation. Note: the alphabetical order rule applies for the der and t abnormalities.




5.7      Ploidy Anomalies

      a. All chromosome changes, whether constitutional or acquired, are expressed in relation to the ap-
         propriate ploidy level (see Section 6.3.7), i.e.,
         • In near-haploid cells (23 chromosomes) in relation to one chromosome of each type (chromo-
             some numbers up to 34).
         • In near-diploid cells (46 chromosomes) in relation to two chromosomes of each type (chromo-
             some numbers 35–57).
         • In near-triploid cells (69 chromosomes) in relation to three chromosomes of each type (chromo-
             some numbers 58–80).
         • In near-tetraploid cells (92 chromosomes) in relation to four chromosomes of each type (chro-
             mosome numbers 81–103), and so on.
         i.    26,X,+4,+6,+21[12]
               The near-haploid karyotype shows two copies of chromosomes 4, 6, and 21, and a single copy of all other chromo-
               somes in a neoplastic sample.

         ii.   69,XXX,del(7)(p11.2)
               The triploid karyotype shows two normal chromosomes 7 and a chromosome 7 with a terminal deletion of the short
               arm at 7p11.2.

         iii. 70,XXX,+del(7)(p11.2)
               The near-triploid karyotype shows three normal chromosomes 7 and an additional, structurally abnormal chromo-
               some 7 with a terminal deletion of the short arm at 7p11.2.

         iv. 71,XXX,+8,+10
               The near-triploid karyotype shows four copies of chromosomes 8 and 10, and three copies of all other chromosomes.
               Note: the number of metaphases is added for a neoplastic sample.

         v.    69,XXY,del(7)(q22),inv(7)(p13q22),t(7;14)(p15;q11.1)
               The triploid karyotype shows no normal chromosome 7. One chromosome 7 has a long arm deletion, one chromo-
               some 7 has an inversion, and one chromosome 7 is involved in a balanced translocation with chromosome 14. Note:
               there is comma (,) separating the chromosome 7 abnormalities to indicate that the abnormalities are on different
               chromosome 7 homologues.

         vi. 69,XXX,der(7)inv(7)(p13q22)del(7)(q22),t(7;14)(p15;q11.1)
               The triploid karyotype shows one derivative chromosome 7 with an inversion involving the segment 7p13 to 7q22,
               and a terminal deletion at 7q22. Another chromosome 7 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with chromosome
               14, and there is one normal chromosome 7.

     vii. 92,XXYY,del(7)(p11.2),t(7;14)(p15;q11.1)
           The tetraploid karyotype shows two normal and two abnormal chromosomes 7: one chromosome 7 with a terminal
           deletion of the short arm, and one chromosome 7 is involved in a balanced translocation with chromosome 14. Note:
           underlining of one homologue is optional (see Section 4.4.2).

     viii. 92,XXYY,del(7)(p11.2),del(7)(q22),del(7)(q34)
           The tetraploid karyotype shows one normal chromosome 7 and three chromosomes 7 with different terminal dele-
           tions.

     ix. 89,XXYY,–1,–3,–5,+8,–21[5]
           The near-tetraploid male karyotype shows three copies of chromosomes 1, 3, 5, and 21, five copies of chromosome
           8, and four copies of all other autosomes in a neoplastic sample.
b. In neoplasms, an appropriate and biologically meaningful ploidy level should be selected for the
   description of the karyotype. The ploidy level (n, 2n, 3n, etc.) may be given in angle brackets
   (< >) after the chromosome number (see Section 6.3.7).
     i.    76∼102<4n>,XXXX,…[15]
           The chromosome numbers vary between hypertriploidy and hypertetraploidy. The symbol <4n> indicates that all
           neoplastic abnormalities are expressed in relation to the tetraploid level.

     ii.   58<2n>,XY,+X,+4,+6,+8,+10,+11,+14,+14,+17,+18,+21,+21[10]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with near-triploidy, and the abnormalities are described in relation to the diploid
           chromosome number. The chromosomes with three copies are listed as additional.
c. Endoreduplication (end) is the replication of the chromosomes without chromatid separation or
   cytokinesis (Fig. 7). Technologies such as SNP microarray may be helpful in differentiating between
   endoreduplication and other mechanisms (e.g., aborted mitosis and cell fusion) that may produce a
   similar copy number change.

6.1            Introduction

               This section defines terms and provides nomenclature for the description of chromosome abnor-
               malities in neoplasia. Unless otherwise indicated the examples in this chapter are given at 400 bands
               per haploid set (bphs). See Section 10.3 for nomenclature to describe targeted karyotype analysis
               and Chapters 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 for molecular cytogenomic and sequencing assays.

                                                   DOI: 10.1159/000538512
6.2        General Principles

      a. See Chapter 4 for general nomenclature rules applicable to neoplasia.
      b. In the description of a karyotype the total number of chromosomes is given first in the ISCN descrip-
         tion, followed by a comma (,) followed by the sex chromosome constitution. Autosomes are spec-
         ified only if they are abnormal and are listed in increasing number order.
      c. The number of cells is given in square brackets ([ ]) for each abnormal clone and the normal cell
         line, if present (see Section 5.1).
      d. Only chromosome abnormalities with demonstrated clonality are reported in the ISCN description
         (see Section 4.5).
         • The location of a breakpoint is specified by the band in which the break has occurred according
              to the banding resolution of the assay.
         • When the same abnormality has been seen at a higher resolution in a previous sample, then the
              higher resolution breakpoints may be reported in subsequent samples.
         • Depending on the banding resolution, a breakpoint may appear to be in a band other than that
              known to contain the gene involved in the rearrangement. Nevertheless, the breakpoint listed in
              ISCN corresponds to the band/subband visualised by the banding technique.
      e. The normal cell line when present, is listed last in the nomenclature description.
      f. Non-clonal abnormalities are not included in the ISCN description; however, they may be discussed
         in the interpretative text.
      g. The karyotype designation of each different clone and subclone is separated by a slant line (/).
      h. In chimerism secondary to stem cell transplant, the recipient cell line(s) are given first, followed
         by the donor cell line(s). The recipient and donor cell line(s) are separated by a double slant line
         (//) (see Section 4.5.3).
      i. The stemline (sl) is the most basic clone of a neoplastic population, and deviating subclones arising
         by clonal evolution are termed sidelines (sdl).
      j. idem (Latin = the same) can be used to describe sidelines and subclones in relation to the first clone
         in the ISCN description. This term makes no assumption regarding the stemline.
      k. Where individual clones are not discernible because of the genomic heterogeneity of the tumor, a
         composite karyotype (cp) is required.
      l. Where chromosome quality is poor and/or there are insufficient metaphases to allow the complete
         karyotype to be determined, an incomplete (inc) karyotype may be given.


6.3        Clones and Subclones

         A clone is defined as a cell population derived from a single progenitor (see Section 4.5). It is not
         necessarily completely homogeneous because subclones may have evolved during development and
         progression of the neoplasm.
      a. Clonal chromosome abnormalities, including the number of metaphases analyzed, are reported in
         the ISCN description. For nomenclature for the targeted scoring of additional metaphases to estab-
         lish clonality or assess clone size, see Section 10.3.
           i.   46,XY,t(7;11)(p15;p15)[12]/46,XY[8]
                Chromosome analysis shows a clone with a translocation between chromosomes 7 and 11 in twelve metaphases at
                400 bphs. This 7;11 translocation in hematological neoplasms forms the NUP98::HOXA9 fusion gene. The NUP98
                and HOXA9 genes are located on 11p15.4 and 7p15.2, respectively, although these subband are not apparent at
                400 bphs.

                            DOI: 10.1159/000538512
        b. When a cytogenetic abnormality has been reported in a previous study and then is found in a single
           metaphase at follow-up, it should be reported in the ISCN.
           i.    46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[1]/46,XX[19]
                 Karyotype shows a single metaphase with an isolated translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 in a follow-up
                 cytogenetic analysis of a case with the same abnormal clone at initial presentation.

        c. When a single abnormal metaphase is confirmed by a different method (e.g., FISH, microarray, ge-
           nome mapping), and thus shown to be clonal, it should be reported in the karyotype (see Section
           4.5.3).

                 An interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 20 is present in a single metaphase from a neoplastic sample.
                 FISH with a 20q12 probe, D20S108, and a control probe for 20q13.3, RH74808, confirmed the deletion of 20q and
                 the clonality of this abnormality.




6.3.1      Clone Size

           i.    46,XX[20]
                 An apparently normal female karyotype is identified in 20 metaphases in a neoplastic sample. Note: the number of
                 metaphases is given in square brackets ([ ]).

           ii.   46,XX,t(8;21)(q22;q22)[23]
                 A clone with a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 is identified in all 23 metaphases by cytogenetic
                 analysis at 400bphs.

                or
                46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[18]/45,XX,der(7;9)(7qter→7q10::9q10→9q34::22q11.2→22qter),

                or
                46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[18]/45,XX,der(7;9)(7qter→7q10::9q10→9q34::22q11.2→22qter),
                der(22)t(9;22)[2]
                 A neoplastic sample shows eighteen metaphases with 46 chromosomes and a translocation between chromosomes
                 9 and 22 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. A subclone of two metaphases has 45 chromosomes and the deriva-
                 tive chromosome 9 from the t(9;22) is further involved in a whole-arm translocation with chromosome 7. The miss-
                 ing chromosomes 7 and 9 are not indicated since they are replaced by the derivative chromosome, der(7;9). There
                 is loss of the short arms of chromosomes 7 and 9. Note: the breakpoints need not be repeated when the same ab-
                 normality is described in additional clones/subclones.

        b. The mainline is the most frequent chromosome constitution of a neoplastic cell population. Main-
           line is a purely quantitative term to describe the largest clone and does not necessarily indicate the
           most basic clone in terms of progression.
           i.    46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[3]/47,XX,+8,t(9;22)[17]
                 The clone with 47 chromosomes and trisomy 8 represents the mainline in this karyotype, although it has most prob-
                 ably evolved from the clone with 46 chromosomes. Note: the order of the cytogenetically related clones is deter-
                 mined by their complexity (see Section 6.3.3.1).

                 The clone with 47 chromosomes represents the mainline in this karyotype, although it has most probably evolved
                 from the clone with 46 chromosomes. Rearrangement involving the ALK gene is confirmed by interphase FISH
                 analysis with a breakapart probe.

          c. When the largest clones (two or more) are of equal size, a neoplasm will have more than one main-
             line.
               i.    45,XX,−7[10]/47,XX,+8[10]
                     Karyotype shows two clones of equal size, each representing the mainline. Monosomy 7 clone is listed before tri-
                     somy 8 clone following the chromosome order rule. For rules concerning clone order when the clones are unre-
                     lated see Section 6.3.3.2




6.3.2          Order of Chromosome Abnormalities

          a. Clonal chromosome abnormalities are listed with sex chromosome abnormalities first, and X be-
             fore Y, followed by autosomes in order of lowest to highest number. The normal sex chromosome
             is listed first in the ISCN description when the other sex chromosome is abnormal (see Section 4.3).
               i.    45,X,−Y,t(8;21)(q22;q22)[20]
                     A translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 is identified in twenty metaphases by cytogenetic analysis at
                     400bphs. The 8;21 translocation in hematological neoplasms forms the RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion gene. The
                     RUNX1T1 gene is known to be located at 8q21.3. At 400bphs the breakpoint is at the interface of 8q21.3 and 8q22.
                     The breakpoint is designated as 8q22 as it is more distal to the centromere (see Section 5.4.1).

               ii.   46,XX,t(10;11)(p12;q14–22),del(13)(q12q22),i(17)(q10)[10]/46,XX[5]
                     Karyotype shows a translocation involving chromosomes 10 and 11, an interstitial deletion of chromosome 13 and
                     an isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 17 in ten metaphases. At 300bphs 11q14 to 11q22 appear as the
                     single band, 11q14–22. No abnormality is detected in five metaphases. The normal cell line is listed last in the ISCN
                     description.

               iii. 46,Y,i(X)(q10)[20]/46,XY[10]
                     Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows an isochromosome of the long arm of the X chromosome in twenty meta-
                     phases and an apparently normal male karyotype in ten metaphases. The normal Y chromosome is given before the
                     abnormal X chromosome in the ISCN description.




6.3.3          Order of Clones

6.3.3.1        Cytogenetically Related Clones


             The order of cytogenetically related clones in the ISCN description is determined by the sequential
             application of the following rules:
          a. Cytogenetically related clones and subclones are written in order of increasing complexity, irrespec-
             tive of their size (see Section 4.5.3). Only the number of aberrations and not the size of the altered
             genomic segment is considered in the application of this rule (see Table 7).
               i.    46,XY,inv(16)(p13.1q22)[10]/46,XY,del(7)(q21),inv(16)[5]
                     Karyotype shows a pericentromeric inversion of chromosome 16 as the sole abnormality in ten metaphases. A sub-
                     clone comprising of five metaphases shows the inv(16) and a terminal deletion of 7q. Note: the stemline, if present,
                     is the least complex clone and is therefore listed first in the ISCN description.

          b. Where abnormalities in different clones with equal complexity involve chromosomes of a different
             number, the chromosome order rule applies, X before Y, followed by autosomes in increasing
             number.
               i.    46,XY,t(1;19)(q23;p13.3),del(9)(p21)[10]/47,XY,t(1;19),+21[10]
                     Two subclones identified by karyotype contain a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 19. The subclone with
                     a terminal deletion of chromosome 9 is given before the subclone with gain of chromosome 21 in the ISCN descrip-
                     tion. Note: the cytogenetically related clones are of equal karyotypic complexity, therefore the chromosome order
                     rule applies.

                                  DOI: 10.1159/000538512
          c. Where abnormalities in different clones with equal complexity involve the same number chromo-
             some, the gain before loss, before structural change rule applies.
             i.    47,XX,t(6;9)(p22;q34),+9[10]/45,XX,t(6;9),−9[10]
                   Two subclones identified by karyotype contain a translocation between chromosomes 6 and 9. The subclone with
                   gain of chromosome 9 is given before the subclone with loss of chromosome 9 in the ISCN description. Note: the
                   cytogenetically related clones are of equal karyotypic complexity, and the abnormalities involve the same number
                   chromosome, therefore the gain before loss, before structural change rule applies.

          d. Where structural abnormalities of the same number chromosome are present in different clones with
             equal complexity, they are reported alphabetically. If structural abnormalities involving the same
             chromosome are of the same type, then the pter to qter rule applies.
             i.    45,XX,−5,add(7)(q34)[15]/45,XX,−5,t(7;8)(q22;q22)[15]
                   Karyotype shows two subclones with monosomy 5. One clone shows additional material of unknown origin replac-
                   ing the distal long arm of chromosome 7 from 7q34 and the other shows a translocation involving chromosome 7
                   at 7q22 and chromosome 8 at 8q22. Since chromosome 7 is involved in both clones then the alphabetical rule of
                   abbreviations applies. In this example add is listed before t.

             ii.   47,XY,+8,del(17)(p13)[15]/47,XY,+8,del(17)(q21)[15]
                   Karyotype shows two subclones with trisomy 8. The subclone with a terminal deletion at 17p13 is given before the
                   subclone with a terminal deletion at 17q21 in the ISCN description. Note: the clones are of equal karyotypic com-
                   plexity, and the abnormalities are of the same type on the same number chromosome, therefore the pter to qter rule
                   applies.

             iii. 48,XY,+8,+17[15]/47,XY,+8,del(17)(p13)[15]/47,XY,+8,del(17)(q21)[15]
                   Karyotype shows three subclones with trisomy 8 and abnormalities of chromosome 17. The subclone with trisomy
                   17 is given first (gains before losses before structural change); the subclone with a terminal deletion at 17p13 is
                   given before the subclone with a terminal deletion at 17q21 in the ISCN description (pter to qter rule applies).




6.3.3.2      Cytogenetically Unrelated Clones


             The order of cytogenetically unrelated clones in the ISCN description is determined by the sequen-
             tial application of the following rules:
          a. Cytogenetically unrelated abnormal clones are written in order of the size of the clone with the larg-
             est clone first, followed by the next largest and so on (see Section 4.5).
             i.    46,XX,t(3;9)(p13;p13)[14]/48,XX,+3,+9[11]/46,XX,t(1;6)(p11;p12)[9]/47,XX,t(6;10)(q12;p15),
                   +7[6]/45,X,−X[3]/46,XX,inv(6)(p22q23)[3]/46,XX[7]
                   Karyotype shows six apparently unrelated abnormal clones. They are given in the order of decreasing size, irre-
                   spective of the type of abnormality or chromosome number involved. Only clones of the same size are listed ac-
                   cording to the chromosome order rule therefore the clone with loss of the X chromosome is given before the clone
                   with an inversion of chromosome 6. The normal cell line is listed last.

          b. Where abnormalities in different clones of equal size involve chromosomes of a different number,
             the chromosome order rule applies; X before Y, followed by autosomes in increasing number.
             i.    47,XX,+8[10]/47,XX,+21[10]
                   Karyotype shows two apparently unrelated clones of equal size and complexity. The clone with trisomy 8 is given
                   in the ISCN description before that of the clone with trisomy 21 following the chromosome order rule.

          c. Where abnormalities in different clones of equal size involve the same chromosome, the gain before
             loss, before structural change rule applies.
             i.    47,XY,+Y[20]/45,X,−Y[20]
                   Karyotype shows two clones of equal size; one clone has Y chromosome gain and the other has Y chromosome
                   loss. The karyotypically unrelated clones are of equal complexity and the abnormalities involve the same chromo-
                   some therefore the gain before loss, before structural change rule applies.

               ii.   47,XX,+8[10]/46,XX,t(8;21)(q22;q22)[10]
                     Karyotype shows two apparently unrelated clones of equal size. The clone with trisomy 8 is given in the ISCN de-
                     scription before the clone with a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 following the gain before loss be-
                     fore structural change rule.

          d. Where structural abnormalities of the same number chromosome are present in different clones with
             equal complexity, they are reported alphabetically. If structural abnormalities involving the same
             chromosome are of the same type, then the pter to qter rule applies.
               i.    46,XX,del(9)(q13q22)[10]/46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[10]
                     Karyotype shows two apparently unrelated clones of equal size. Each clone shows a structural change of chromo-
                     some 9 so the alphabetical rule determines the order of the clones in the ISCN description, del before t.

               ii.   46,XY,del(9)(p13)[15]/46,XY,del(9)(q22)[15]
                     Karyotype shows two apparently unrelated clones of equal size. One clone shows a terminal deletion of the short
                     arm of chromosome 9, and the other shows a terminal deletion from the long arm of chromosome 9. Therefore, the
                     pter to qter rule determines the order of the clones in the ISCN description.

               iii. 46,XX,add(7)(q22)[15]/46,XX,t(7;9)(q22;p21)[15]
                     Karyotype shows two apparently unrelated clones of equal size. One clone shows additional material of unknown
                     origin replacing the distal long arm of chromosome 7 from 7q22 and the other shows a translocation between chro-
                     mosome 7 at 7q22 and chromosome 9 at 9p21. Since there is a chromosome 7 abnormality in both clones then the
                     alphabetical rule of abbreviations applies. In this example add is listed before t.




6.3.3.3        Mixed Cytogenetically Related and Unrelated Clones


          a. If a neoplasm contains both related and unrelated clones, the cytogenetically related clones are pre-
             sented according to the rules in Section 6.3.3.1, followed by the unrelated clones according to the
             rules in Section 6.3.3.2.
               i.    45,XY,−5[3]/44,XY,−5,−7[15]/45,XY,−10[15]/46,XY,del(11)(q23)[15]
                     Karyotype shows two cytogenetically related clones and two cytogenetically unrelated clones. The cytogenetically
                     related clones are given first in order of increasing complexity, followed by the unrelated clones. Since the unre-
                     lated clones are the same size they are given in chromosome order.

                     Karyotype shows three cytogenetically related clones and three additional cytogenetically unrelated clones. The
                     cytogenetically related clones are given first in order of increasing complexity followed by the three unrelated clones
                     in order of decreasing frequency.
          b. If a previously identified abnormality is found among other unrelated clones, it should be given first,
             regardless of the number of metaphases in which it is identified.
               i.    46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[6]/46,XY,t(1;3)(p22;p14)[14]
                     The t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) is identified at initial presentation. At follow-up the t(9;22) is persisting and an unrelated
                     clone involving t(1;3)(p22;p14) has emerged. Although the number of metaphases in the unrelated clone is larger,
                     it is written after the previously identified clone in the ISCN description.

6.3.4        Clonal Evolution

             Where possible the nomenclature in this section should be used to describe subclones so that clonal
             evolution is evident. In some neoplastic studies clonal evolution is not linear and this may result in
             a mix of abnormal metaphases with clonal and nonclonal changes. For these cases a composite
             karyotype can be used to describe the clonal abnormalities (see Section 6.3.5).
        a.   The stemline (sl) is the most basic clone of a neoplastic cell population and is listed first in the ISCN
             description. All additional deviating subclones are termed sidelines (sdl). To describe the stemlines
             and sidelines, these abbreviations, or the term idem (Latin = same), can be used. Note: it may be
             unclear whether the least complex clone in a karyotype is the stemline or is, itself, an evolved sub-
             clone. In this case, idem is preferred.
             • If sl is used in the ISCN description, it indicates that the sideline contains the sex chromosome
                 complement and the karyotypic abnormalities of the stemline.
             • sdl indicates that the subclone contains the sex chromosome complement and the karyotypic
                 abnormalities of the sideline.
             • idem refers only to the karyotype of the clone listed first and replaces the sex chromosome
                 complement and the abnormalities of the first clone.
        b.   In neoplastic karyotypes where idem is used, the chromosome number of each subclone is given
             and followed by the additional changes in the subclone in relation to the most basic clone, that is
             given first.
        c.   The terms idem and sl must not be intermixed in the ISCN description.
        d.   If more than one stemline (sl) is present, as may occur in concomitant neoplasms, these may be re-
             ferred to as sl1, sl2, etc.
        e.   If more than one sideline (sdl) is present, these may be referred to as sdl1, sdl2, etc. For each of
             these, several sub-sidelines may also exist. The use of sdl in this instance reduces clarity and so idem
             is preferred.
        f.   The term sl or sdl multiplied by a number (×2, ×3, etc.) may be used to describe aberrant polyploid
             clones. Alternatively, the term idem multiplied by a number (×2, ×3, etc.,) may be used. Addition-
             al abnormalities in the polyploid clone may then be indicated using conventional terminology.

                   46,XY,t(8;21)(q22;q22)[26]/47,sl,+21[7]
                   Karyotype shows a clone of twenty-six metaphases with 46 chromosomes and a translocation between chromo-
                   somes 8 and 21 as the sole abnormality. A subclone of seven metaphases with 47 chromosomes and the t(8;21),
                   shows trisomy 21. Alternatively, idem or sl may be used to replace the sex chromosome complement and abnor-
                   malities seen in the initial clone.

                   Karyotype shows a clone with 46 chromosomes representing the stemline (sl); the three subclones with 47, 48 and
                   49 chromosomes are sidelines. In the subclone with 47 chromosomes and trisomy 8, sl indicates the sex chromo-
                   some complement and the presence of the abnormal chromosomes seen in the stemline, i.e., XX and t(9;22)
                   (q34;q11.2). This subclone is sideline 1 (sdl1). In the subclone, sdl2, with 48 chromosomes and trisomy 9, sdl1
                   indicates the sex chromosome complement and the presence of the abnormalities seen in the first sideline, i.e.,
                   XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) and trisomy 8, and so on. As an alternative, in each subclone the sex chromosome comple-
                   ment and the translocation 9;22 are replaced by idem. The terms idem and sl must not be intermixed in the ISCN
                   description.

          The clone with t(8;21) as the sole abnormality is the most basic and hence represents the stemline; the other sub-
          clones are listed in order of increasing karyotypic complexity of the aberrations acquired during clonal evolution.

          Karyotype shows a subclone with 49 chromosomes that has the abnormalities seen in the stemline plus an extra
          chromosome 6. There is a subclone with 50 chromosomes that has the abnormalities of the sideline and has also
          acquired trisomy 7, monosomy 8, and trisomy 9.

          or
          26,X,+4,+6,+21[3]/52,idem×2[13]
          Karyotype shows a near-haploid stemline with two copies of chromosomes 4, 6, and 21, and a single copy of all
          other chromosomes. In the subclone, doubling of the near-haploid clone (likely due to endoreduplication), is also
          identified.

          A subsequent sample of the diagnostic example (v) (see above) shows cytogenetic relapse: nine metaphases have
          52 chromosomes with the same chromosome complement as reported in the diagnostic sample. A subclone show-
          ing clonal evolution comprises three metaphases with 51 chromosomes and loss of one chromosome 10. Eighteen
          metaphases show an apparently normal female karyotype. The stemline (26,X,+4,+6,+21) seen in the diagnostic
          sample is not detected. Note: only the term idem can be used in this ISCN description (and not sl) since the diag-
          nostic stemline is not present.

          Karyotype shows a stemline with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 as the sole cytogenetic abnormal-
          ity. Two additional abnormal subclones are identified. One is tetraploid due to doubling of the stemline. The other
          is near-tetraploid because of gain of chromosome 8 in the tetraploid sideline. As an alternative, idem may be used,
          but all subclones refer back to the stemline.

     viii. 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[3]/47,idem,+8[10]/47,idem,+19[3]/48,idem,+8,+der(22)t(9;22)[4]
          Karyotype shows a stemline with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 as the sole cytogenetic abnormal-
          ity. Three abnormal subclones show clonal evolution. The first subclone has trisomy 8 and the t(9;22) from the
          stemline, the second subclone has trisomy 19 and the t(9;22) from the stemline, and the third subclone has an ad-
          ditional derivative chromosome 22 and is probably derived from the 47,idem,+8[10] subclone. The order of the first
          and second subclones in the ISCN description is determined by the complexity and chromosome order rules. The
          third subclone is listed last as it is more complex than the previous subclones. Note: the use of idem is preferred as
          sl and sdl would reduce clarity.

         t(9;22)×2[2]
          In a neoplasm with unrelated clones, there may be clonal evolution arising from each unrelated stemline. In the
          above example, the first stemline, sl1, shows monosomy 7 and the subclone derived from it showing trisomy 8. The
          second stemline, sl2, shows t(9;22) and clonal evolution gives rise to the subclone showing tetraploidy. Further
          clonal evolution is found in a sideline showing gain of chromosome 8, but to avoid confusion between sidelines of
          sl1 and sl2, the term sdl is not used when referring to subclones of a second stemline. The alternative use of idem
          is shown for comparison. Note: idem refers only to sl1.

        Karyotype shows a mainline with 96 chromosomes representing doubling of the hyperdiploid stemline, inversion
        of one chromosome 3 and an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation between one other chromosome 3 homo-
        logue and chromosome 6 i.e., there are two normal chromosomes 3 and three normal chromosomes 6 in this near-
        tetraploid subclone. Note: inv(3) is given before t(3;6) following the alphabetical order rule.

        Karyotype shows a stemline with a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 14 and 18, and trisomy of chromo-
        somes 1, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 20. A sideline shows the same sex chromosome complement and chromosome ab-
        normalities as the stemline, with an additional (apparently terminal) deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7.

        Karyotype shows four additional changes in the subclone with 49 chromosomes in relation to the apparent stemline.
        It is possible that the two clones in this example arose through divergent clonal evolution from an undetected stem-
        line with 46,XY,t(1;6). In this case idem may be more appropriate than sl. Note: the stemline has monosomy 3
        whereas the sideline has two normal chromosomes 3, i.e., the +3 in this situation does not indicate that the clone
        has trisomy 3. Alternatively, the karyotype may be written in full for clarity.

        and chromosome 20 with a breakpoint at 20q11.2. The segments from 9pter to 9p13 and from 20q11.2 to 20qter

        Chromosome analysis shows a stemline with an inversion of chromosome 6, trisomy 12 and an interstitial deletion of
        the long arm of chromosome 13. The inversion of chromosome 6 is absent from the sideline and the breakpoints do not
        need to be repeated. It is possible that these two clones arose through divergent clonal evolution from an undetected
        stemline with trisomy 12 and interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13, in which case the use of idem may
        be preferred. Note: there is monosomy 6 in the sideline. Note: the karyotype may be written in full for clarity.

        Karyotype shows a subclone with 44 chromosomes that has lost the abnormal chromosome 10 (with additional
        material at band 10q26) and one of the marker chromosomes seen in the stemline. Note: there is monosomy 10 in
        the subclone. There are three additional changes in the subclone; additional material of unknown origin attached to
        3p12, monosomy 5, and trisomy 8. Alternatively, the ISCN could be written in full for clarity:

         The karyotype of this example is represented diagrammatically in Figure 8 and described above. The karyotype
         shows a stemline with 46 chromosomes and a t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). Clonal evolution has resulted in two unrelated
         sidelines:
         •     a sideline with Y chromosome loss i.e., 45,X,−Y,t(9;22)
         •    a second sideline with trisomy 8 i.e., 47,XY,+8,t(9;22)
         The −Y sideline then shows further clonal evolution that branches:
         •    one subclone shows monosomy 7 i.e., 44,X,−Y,−7,t(9;22)
         •     another subclone shows an isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 17 i.e., 45,X,−Y,t(9;22),i(17)(q10)
         The monosomy 7 subclone (with t(9;22) and −Y) has three subclones:
         •     45,X,−Y,−7,t(9;22),+11
         •     45,X,−Y,−7,t(9;22),+21
         •     45,X,−Y,−7,t(9;22),+der(22)t(9;22)
         The i(17q) subclone has a sub-subclone with trisomy 21:
         •     46,X,−Y,t(9;22),i(17),+21
         The sideline with +8 shows a divergent branch of clonal evolution. It has two subclones:
         •     one subclone with gain of chromosome 19 i.e., 48,XY,+8,t(9;22),+19
         •     another subclone with gain of chromosome 21 i.e., 48,XY,+8,t(9;22),+21
         One of these subclones shows further clonal evolution. It is possible that either the subclone with +19 gained a
         chromosome 21 or the +21 clone gained a chromosome 19. This is represented by the dotted lines in Figure 8. The
         nomenclature description does not make any assumption concerning the subclone/sub-subclone relationship but
         rather describes each clone and subclone firstly following the chromosome order rule (−Y before +8) and then by
         increasing order of complexity. Note: the description of cell lines with divergent clonal evolution is not possible
         using sl and sdl. The karyotype is described following the ISCN rules (see Section 6.3.3.1).

                  The karyotype of this example is represented diagrammatically in Figure 9 and described above. The karyotype
                  shows two unrelated stemlines that each show clonal evolution.
                  The larger stemline is listed first followed by the related sidelines applying the rules:
                  • sex chromosomes (X before Y) before autosomes,
                  • autosomes in order of increasing number,
                  • increasing order of complexity.
                  The smaller unrelated stemline (47,XY,+8) is given next followed by its related sidelines, applying the same rules.
                  Note: idem does not distinguish between the two stem lines and so for clarity sl1 and sl2 may be used.




6.3.5      Composite Karyotype

        a. In many instances, especially in solid tumors, there is karyotypic heterogeneity within the neoplasm,
           but different metaphases nevertheless share some cytogenetic characteristics.
        b. Every effort should be made to describe the subclones so that clonal evolution is evident. However,
           in some instances, a composite karyotype (cp) will have to be created. The composite karyotype

                                                                 DOI: 10.1159/000538512
   contains only clonally occurring abnormalities and gives the range of chromosome numbers in the
   metaphases containing the clonal abnormalities. A karyotype may show a mix of fully characterised
   clones and subclones, in addition to subclone(s) being given as composite(s) (see Section 6.3.5).
c. The total number of metaphases in which the clonal changes are observed is given in [ ] after the
   karyotype, preceded by cp. The abbreviation cp is not used to describe obvious random loss in an
   otherwise normal result i.e., random losses or gains should be interpreted as consistent with techni-
   cal artifact and should not be included in nomenclature. This is distinct from the composite karyo-
   type (cp) where clonal changes are identified in the context of non-clonal abnormalities.
d. It is not always apparent from a composite karyotype (cp) how many metaphases have each ab-
   normality. This information may be expressed by providing the number of metaphases in square
   brackets ([ ]) after each abnormality.
     i.    45~48,XX,del(3)(p12)[2],−5[4],+8[2],+11[3][cp7]
           A composite karyotype is constructed from analysis of seven metaphases, each with at least one of the abnormali-
           ties listed. Two metaphases show a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 with a breakpoint in 3p12,
           four metaphases show monosomy 5, two metaphases show trisomy 8, and three metaphases show trisomy 11. Some
           metaphases show more than one of these abnormalities. Note: the sum of the clonal abnormalities indicates a chro-
           mosome count of 47 but metaphases with 45 and up to 48 chromosomes are identified.

     ii.   47~55,XX,del(3)(p12),+i(6)(p10),del(7)(q11.2),+8,dup(11)(q13q25),+16,+17,der(18)t(18;20)
           (q23;q11.1),+21,+21,+22[cp24]
           All of the abnormalities may not be present in a single metaphase but each of the abnormalities in this cytogenetic
           analysis is present in at least two metaphases. Note: some metaphases with 55 chromosomes show additional non-
           clonal chromosome gains and losses.

     iii. 63~74(35,X,+X,+1,+6,+8,+10,+11,+14,+15,+18,+19,+21,+22)×2,−2,−5,−16[cp12]
           In this composite karyotype of twelve metaphases, where the chromosome number ranges between 63 and 74, each
           metaphase shows at least one of the listed abnormalities. There is an apparent doubling of hypodiploid cells with
           further loss of chromosomes 2, 5 and 16 (see Section 6.3.7). Note: while the count falls within the near-triploid
           range, it is reported relative to haploid in conjunction with supporting evidence from the result of a previous diag-
           nostic sample or from alternative methods e.g., SNP microarray.

     iv. 69~73,XXY,+Y,+1,−4,−13,del(17)(p11.2),+21,+21,+22[cp10]/46,XY[10]
           A composite karyotype in a male shows near-triploidy with gain of a Y chromosome, aneuploidy of several auto-
           somes (chromosomes 1, 4, 13, 21 and 22), and an apparently terminal deletion of 17p. Note: in males all sex chro-
           mosome deviation is expressed in relation to XXY in triploid neoplasms (see Section 6.3.7).
e. In a composite karyotype the sum of the aberrations listed may indicate a higher or lower chromo-
   some number than that actually seen.
     i.    48,XX,+7,+9
           48,XX,+7,+11
           48,XX,+9,+11
           48,XX,+9,+13
           48,XX,+13,+21

           The composite karyotype of these five metaphases is:
           48,XX,+7,+9,+11,+13[cp5]
           or
           48,XX,+7[2],+9[3],+11[2],+13[2][cp5]
           The chromosome number of the five metaphases containing a clonal abnormality is 48, which is given as the chro-
           mosome number of the composite karyotype, although the sum total of all the clonal changes indicates a chromo-
           some number of 50. Note: a metaphase with 50 chromosomes is not present.

         or
         43~46,XX,−7[4],+8[2][cp4]
         Note: the metaphase with 42 chromosomes is not included because the abnormalities are due to random loss and
         are not part of the clone.

         [cp4]
         Karyotype shows a stemline with a 9;22 translocation. Multiple metaphases are found with gain and loss of chro-
         mosomes, likely due to clonal evolution. As not all aberrations are present in all metaphases, these metaphases are
         combined into a composite karyotype. Note: the stemline shows the t(9;22) and the subclone is shown using a com-
         posite karyotype.

       46,XY,inv(3)(q21q26.2)

         The composite karyotype of the ten near-diploid metaphases is:
         44∼47,XY,inv(3)(q21q26.2),−7,+8,+14[cp10]
         All metaphases analyzed show an inversion of chromosome 3. Nine metaphases also show gain or loss of various
         chromosomes, likely due to clonal evolution. Not all aberrations are present in all metaphases, therefore, ten meta-
         phases are combined into a composite karyotype. Note: the metaphase with 25 chromosomes, shows random loss
         of several chromosomes and is excluded from the composite karyotype since it does not contribute to establishing
         the clonality of the abnormalities and its chromosome number would alter the ploidy level erroneously.

                   The composite karyotype of these six metaphases is:

                   Two metaphases show two normal sex chromosomes (XX) that are given in the composite karyotype and the ab-
                   normality affecting an X chromosome is also given since it is seen in four metaphases. Note: there is no metaphase
                   with three X chromosomes.

                 44,X,−X,−7
                 46,XX

                   The composite karyotype of these six metaphases is:
                   44∼46,X,−X,del(16)(q24),+21[cp5]/46,XX[1]
                   The abnormality of the sex chromosome complement in the neoplastic sample is indicated in the composite karyo-
                   type. Loss of chromosome 7 in the metaphase with 44,X,−X,−7, is not clonal and therefore is not included in the
                   composite karyotype. Note: additional chromosome analysis (if possible) is appropriate to exclude monosomy 7.

        f. A composite karyotype may contain such seemingly paradoxical abnormalities as loss and gain of
           the same chromosome. For example, if the following six metaphases are karyotyped:
             i.    45,XX,−15,del(17)(p11.3)
                   46,XX,+7,−15,del(17)(p11.3)
                   46,XX,+12,−15
                   47,XX,+7
                   47,XX,+15,del(17)(p11.3)
                   48,XX,+12,+15

                   The composite karyotype of these six metaphases is:
                   45∼48,XX,+7,+12,+15,−15,del(17)(p11.3)[cp6]
                   or
                   45∼48,XX,+7[2],+12[2],+15[2],−15[3],del(17)(p11.3)[3][cp6]
                   Trisomy 15 and monosomy 15 are both clonal changes, present in two and three metaphases, respectively. If there
                   are both gains and losses of the same chromosome, gains are listed before the losses in the ISCN (see Section 4.5.3).



6.3.6        Incomplete Karyotype

        a. When chromosome quality is poor and/or metaphases are scarce, it may be necessary to create an
           incomplete (inc) karyotype (see Section 5.1).
        b. The use of this term is limited to rare instances when one or more abnormalities can be identified,
           but it is uncertain whether the remaining chromosomes are morphologically normal. The karyotype
           may contain unidentified structural or numerical changes in addition to the abnormalities listed.
        c. The abbreviation inc is placed at the end of the nomenclature description, after the description of
           identifiable abnormalities, and is preceded by a comma (,).
             i.    46,XX,del(1)(q21),inc[4]
                   A neoplastic sample where it has only been possible to identify a clonally occurring deletion of the long arm of
                   chromosome 1, but analysis is incomplete. Without the abbreviation inc, the del(1)(q21) would be the sole anom-
                   aly present in this neoplasm.

             ii.   46,XX,der(19)t(1;19)(q23;p13),inc[4]
                   The chromosomes in this example could be counted however, the banding and morphology are too poor to allow
                   complete analysis. A derivative chromosome 19 from a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 19 is identified.
                   Use of inc indicates that this may not be the sole clonal abnormality in this neoplastic sample.

                 This abnormal neoplastic sample has, in addition to the abnormalities presented that include three marker chromo-
                 somes, other changes that could not be identified. The abbreviation cp indicates a composite karyotype from 10
                 cells (see Section 6.3.5).

                 A single metaphase with 45,XY,−5 and a single metaphase with the karyotype 47,XY,−5,+17,+18 are identified,
                 although the presence of additional clonal changes could not be excluded. FISH confirmed the monosomy 5 cell
                 line but interphase FISH for chromosomes 17 and 18 failed to achieve a result. The trisomies of chromosomes 17
                 and 18 have not been confirmed and therefore cannot be reported. Whether this sample is reported or additional
                 testing is undertaken to confirm the finding is at the discretion of the laboratory.

                 Taken together these two metaphases can be reported as:
                 31~45,XY,inv(3)(q21q26.2),−7,+8,–9,inc[cp2]
                 Only two metaphases are found on karyotype; both show an inversion of chromosome 3, monosomy 7, trisomy 8
                 and monosomy 9. There are fourteen other chromosome losses in one of the metaphases. Not all aberrations are
                 present in both metaphases, therefore these metaphases are combined into an incomplete karyotype. Note: it is nec-
                 essary to include the metaphase with 31 chromosomes in the karyotype, even though it shows probable random loss
                 of several chromosomes, because it establishes clonality of the abnormalities in the other metaphase. The interpre-
                 tative comment should include a statement concerning the lack of accuracy of the chromosome number. The mono-
                 somies of chromosome 7 and 9 are included according to the rule that two metaphases with identical losses of one
                 or more chromosomes and the same structural abnormality may be considered clonal (see Section 4.5.1). They may
                 be discussed in the interpretive text at the discretion of the laboratory. Confirmatory investigations could also be
                 considered before reporting this case.




6.3.7       Modal Number and Ploidy Levels

        a. The modal number is the most common chromosome number in a neoplastic cell population.
        b. The modal number may be expressed as a range between two chromosome numbers.
        c. Modal numbers are given in either the haploid (n), diploid (2n), triploid (3n) or tetraploid (4n) range.
           When the chromosome number is not equal to a multiple of the haploid number, it may be expressed
           as near-haploid (n±), hypohaploid (n−), hyperhaploid (n+), near-diploid (2n±), hypodiploid (2n−),
           hyperdiploid (2n+), near-triploid (3n±), hypotriploid (3n−), hypertriploid (3n+), near-tetraploid
           (4n±), hypotetraploid (4n−), hypertetraploid (4n+), and so on (see Table 6).

d. Each range is determined as n±n/2, with n/2 defined operationally as 11 chromosomes.
e. The ploidy level is expressed within angle brackets (< >) e.g., 58<2n>,XX,+X,+8,+11,+14,+17,
   +18,+18,+19,+20,+21,+21,+22[10]
f. Ploidy levels are recommended but exceptions may be made if biologically significant or clinically
   relevant in the specific disease.
     i.    81<3n>,XXX,+X,+X,+X,+X,+X,+1,+1,+3,+3,+14,+14,+14,−15,+21[10]
           A neoplasm in a female shows 81 chromosomes but is reported relative to triploid since most chromosomes are
           trisomic and this is biologically significant for the disease in question, even though the count is in the near-tetraploid
           range.

     ii.   58<2n>,XY,+X,+4,+6,+8,+9,+10,+14,+14,+17,+18,+21,+21[20]
           A neoplastic sample in the hypotriploid range is reported relative to a diploid chromosome number, which is bio-
           logically significant in this particular disease.

g. Pseudodiploid, pseudotriploid, etc., are used to describe a karyotype that has the number of chro-
   mosomes equal to a multiple of the haploid number (euploid) but is abnormal because of the pres-
   ence of acquired numerical and/or structural aberrations.
     i.    46,XX,−5,+8[10]
           A neoplastic sample with a pseudodiploid karyotype of 46 chromosomes with monosomy 5 and trisomy 8.

     ii.   69<3n>,XXY,−5,−7,+10,+17[8]
           A neoplastic sample with a pseudotriploid karyotype of 69 chromosomes with loss of chromosomes 5 and 7 and
           tetrasomy of chromosomes 10 and 17.


h. Doubling of a clone may occur e.g., by endoreduplication. Doubled hyperhaploid clones leading to
   masked hypodiploidy may be the largest clones at diagnosis. Classification of masked hypodip-
   loidy is clinically challenging and can impact patient management. Additional chromosome abnor-
   malities can arise after chromosome doubling. To clarify the true ploidy of masked hypodiploid
   karyotypes, the stemline can be noted in the ISCN description immediately following the chromo-
   some number of the masked hypodiploid clone. Additional testing must be performed to provide
   supporting evidence of the stemline.
i. The description of sex chromosome abnormalities poses a special problem in male neoplasms with
   uneven ploidy levels (haploid, triploid, pentaploid, etc.) because the expected sex chromosome con-
   stitution cannot be deduced. For example, the sex chromosome constitution of a triploid neoplasm
   might theoretically be XXY or XYY. By convention, in males all sex chromosome deviation should
   be expressed in relation to X in haploid neoplasms, to XXY in triploid neoplasms, to XXXYY in
   pentaploid neoplasms, and so on.
     i.    25,X,+Y,+21[1]/50,XY,+X,+Y,+21,+21[19]

           25,X,+Y,+21[1]/50(25,X,+Y,+21)×2[19]
           Karyotype shows one metaphase with a hyperhaploid karyotype and nineteen metaphases with an apparently hy-
           perdiploid karyotype resulting from a doubling of the hyperhaploid clone. Note: the single near-haploid metaphase
           is included in the report since its clonality is demonstrated by the presence of doubled near-haploid metaphases (see
           Section 6.3).

     ii.   50(25,X,+X,+21)×2[9]/46,XX[11]
           An apparently hyperdiploid clone comprised of nine metaphases arose from the doubling of a hyperhaploid clone.
           Eleven metaphases show an apparently normal female karyotype. Note: doubling of the hyperhaploid clone is only
           reported as 50(25,X,+X,+21)×2 with supporting evidence from an alternative method e.g., FISH shows the near-
           haploid stemline, SNP microarray shows homozygosity of disomic chromosomes, or a hyperhaploid clone in a
           previous analysis.

                An apparently hyperdiploid clone arises from the doubling of a hyperhaploid clone, and there is gain of an addi-
                tional chromosome 6 after the doubling. The sex chromosome constitution of neoplastic cells may not reflect the
                sex chromosome complement of the individual’s normal cells. In this example the hyperhaploid clone contains the
                X chromosome (the Y chromosome is lost in the formation of the hyperhaploid clone) and has gained another copy
                of the X chromosome. The apparently normal male karyotype is present in thirteen metaphases. Note: notation for
                the doubling of a hyperhaploid clone can only be used when it is supported by the results obtained from alternative
                methods, or from a previous analysis.

          iv. 68,XY,−X[10]
                Karyotype of a neoplasm in a male shows triploidy with loss of a sex chromosome in all ten metaphases obtained
                for analysis.

                The stemline is represented by six hyperhaploid metaphases. A subclone of two metaphases exhibits an additional
                chromosome 18. Nine metaphases show an apparently hyperdiploid clone arising from the doubling of the hyper-
                haploid stemline. No abnormality is detected in four metaphases.

          vi. 32,−X,+Y,+3,+5,+7,+9,+11,+15,+18,+19,+21[16]/46,XY[14]
                Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows hyperhaploidy with additional copies of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15,
                18, 19 and 21 relative to the haploid set in 16 metaphases. Fourteen metaphases show an apparently normal male
                karyotype. Note: the sex chromosome complement is described as −X and +Y following the convention that sex
                chromosomes are expressed in relation to X in haploid neoplasms.



6.4       Constitutional Karyotype

      a. The same clonality criteria (see Section 6.3) apply to metaphases containing the constitutional karyo-
         type as to metaphases containing acquired chromosome abnormalities.
      b. A normal diploid clone, when present, is listed last.
      c. A constitutional abnormality may be indicated by the letter c after the abnormality designation.
         Note: when the inheritance is known the c is replaced by the relevant abbreviation mat, pat, dmat,
         or dpat.
      d. In the description of the karyotype, the constitutional and acquired anomalies are listed in chromo-
         some number order (see Section 4.3).
      e. A clone with only a constitutional abnormality is listed last (as it is the normal clone for that indi-
         vidual).
      f. If the karyotype includes a constitutional and an acquired gain of the same chromosome, the
         constitutional gain is listed first.
          i.    47,XXYc[5]/46,XY[15] or 47,XY,+X[5]/46,XY[15]
                Karyotype of a neoplastic sample in a male with either constitutional mosaicism for an extra X chromosome or
                acquired gain of one X chromosome. In this example or is used to describe the alternative options when further
                studies are not possible, or have not yet been undertaken.

           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with a constitutional, maternally inherited inversion of chromosome 10 and ac-
           quired trisomies 8 and 21. Note: when the inheritance is known, mat or pat takes the place of the c.

     vi. 47,XX,del(5)(q15),+mar c[20]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with a constitutional marker chromosome of unknown origin and an acquired
           deletion of the long arm of one chromosome 5. For constitutional markers, there is a space between mar and c (see
           Section 4.4.1).

     vii. 48,XY,+8,+21c[3]/49,idem,+9[5]/47,XY,+21c[12]
           Karyotype of a neoplastic sample with a constitutional trisomy 21 and acquired trisomies 8 and 9. The clone with
           only the constitutional trisomy 21 is listed last irrespective of the size of this clone.

     viii. 47,XX,t(2;13)(q37;q14),der(14;21)(q10;q10)c,+18,+mar[3]/45,XX,der(14;21)c[17]
           An individual with a constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 14 and 21 shows two cell
           lines by cytogenetic analysis. The neoplastic clone shows an acquired t(2;13), trisomy 18 and an unidentified mark-
           er chromosome in addition to the constitutional der(14;21). The constitutional cell line with the der(14;21) is listed
           last.

g. To describe acquired abnormalities affecting one of the chromosomes of a pair that is involved in a
   constitutional abnormality, the constitutional aberration must always be given, even if none of the
   neoplastic metaphases have this particular aberration. Thus, an acquired abnormality is always pre-
   sented in relation to the constitutional karyotype.
     i.    46,XXYc,−X[20]
           Neoplastic sample from a patient with Klinefelter syndrome with an acquired loss of one X chromosome.

     ii.   46,XX,+21c,−21[20]
           Karyotype of a patient with a constitutional trisomy 21 and the acquired abnormality in the neoplastic metaphases
           is a loss of one chromosome 21.

     iii. 45,Xc,t(X;18)(p11.1;q11.1)[20]
           Neoplastic sample from a patient with Turner syndrome (45,X) shows an acquired t(X;18), i.e., the only X chromo-
           some is involved in the translocation and consequently there is no normal X chromosome in the neoplastic meta-
           phases. Note: in a female with a normal sex chromosome constitution and acquired t(X;18), the karyotype would
           be: 46,X,t(X;18)(p11.1;q11.1)[20].

           A female patient with a known constitutional t(11;12)(p13;q22) shows an acquired t(9;11) that is a recurrent rear-
           rangement in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The derivative chromosome 11 involved in the t(11;12)c is also involved
           in the t(9;11) abnormality. The resulting karyotype, with both constitutional and acquired aberrations, should list
           each aberrant chromosome as a derivative. The abbreviation, c, is used to show that each derivative chromosome
           has a component of the constitutional translocation.

           Male patient with a constitutional Robertsonian der(13;14)(q10;q10) shows loss of the Y chromosome in five meta-
           phases. There is also a t(11;14) in a neoplastic clone. The derivative chromosome 14 involved in the der(13;14)c is
           described as der(13;14)(q10;q10)c t(11;14). Note: there is a space between c and t(11;14).

           A male recipient of an allogeneic stem cell transplant from his mother has a known constitutional t(2;15)(q21;q26.1)
           and shows a composite karyotype composed of three metaphases, with a der(6)t(6;17), der(7;12) and a marker chro-
           mosome. Seven metaphases contain only the constitutional t(2;15) without acquired clonal abnormalities. Note: the
           ten metaphases from the female donor also exhibit a constitutional t(2;5).

6.5      Counting Chromosome Abnormalities

         The recommended method for counting chromosome abnormalities is outlined below and in Tables
         7 and 8.
      a. Only acquired clonal abnormalities are counted. Constitutional abnormalities are not counted.
      b. Where multiple clones are present, each independent abnormality is counted only once.
      c. Disease-specific definitions, as described in Chun et al. (2010), Grimwade et al. (2010), Baliakas et
         al. (2019) and Haase et al. (2019), are used for cytogenomic prognostic risk assessment. To deter-
         mine cytogenetic complexity in a specific disease, it is mandatory to count chromosome abnor-
         malities in the same manner as described in the corresponding study on which the prognostic
         system was based.

bAdditional material of unknown origin (add) scores 1 since the origin of the extra genomic segment is unknown e.g., an add could be a
single copy gain.
cDeletions of different chromosomes score 1 for each chromosome.
dder(11)t(2;11) is not counted as a separate additional abnormality as it is related to the der(2).

d. Two approaches have been employed to deal with more than one clone: counting the total number
   of distinct chromosomal abnormalities in the entire sample or counting clonal chromosomal abnor-
   malities in metaphases with the highest number of abnormalities. They have been adopted in differ-
   ent studies for risk stratification. The former method has the advantage of accounting for heteroge-

   approach has been applied in Table 7.

7.1           Introduction

              Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a targeted method to investigate whole chromosomes,
              chromosome regions, and/or gene regions for the presence or absence of numerical and/or struc-
              tural abnormality. The history of developments in FISH technology is well documented (Cremer et
              al., 1986; Landegent et al., 1987; Lichter et al., 1988; Lichter et al., 1990; Pinkel et al., 1988; Trask,
              1991; Wiegant et al., 1993; Guan et al., 1994; Liehr et al., 2006). The application of FISH probes to
              free, linearly extended chromatin fibers (fiber FISH) increased the resolution of FISH interphase
              mapping to ≤1 kb (Wiegant et al., 1992; Parra and Windle, 1993). Fiber FISH is not commonly used
              in the diagnostic setting and the nomenclature is not included in ISCN 2024; however, the nomen-
              clature remains available in ISCN 2020.


7.1.1         General Principles and Rules

             These rules apply to metaphase and interphase in situ hybridization (ISH).
          a. In situ hybridization is performed on preparations of metaphase chromosomes (ish) or interphase
             nuclei (nuc ish):
             • The abbreviation ish is followed by a space, the chromosome and/or abbreviation for the type
                 of abnormality or band location and then the metaphase in situ hybridization results (see Section
                 7.2.1).
             • The abbreviation nuc ish is followed by a space, and then the interphase in situ hybridization
                 results (see Section 7.3.1).
             • If the conventional karyotype or another technique precedes the in situ hybridization result in
                 the ISCN description, then the result of this technique is followed by a period (.) before ish or
                 nuc ish.
          b. In situ hybridization probes are given in the ISCN description in capital letters and are described in
             the nomenclature using one of the following identifiers (listed below in order of preference):
             • STS marker name, i.e., D-number, or BAC clone name.
             • Gene symbol, designated according to either the UCSC or Ensembl Genome Browsers (www.
                 genome.ucsc.edu/ and www.ensembl.org/) or HUGO-approved nomenclature (http://www.
                 hugo-international.org/).


          In situ Hybridization                     Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                     97
                                                    DOI: 10.1159/000538512
             •   Probe manufacturer’s name for the region or loci/locus.
                  Examples of each of these are provided within this chapter.
        c.   Gene names for probes are not italicized in the ISCN description but the corresponding gene loci
             are italicized in the report text.
        d.   Probes are listed in the ISCN description in chromosome order, i.e.,
             • Probes on sex chromosomes are given before those on autosomes (and X before Y).
             • Probes on lower number autosomes are given before those on higher number autosomes. Where
                 there are two or more derivative chromosomes on metaphase in situ hybridization the derivative
                 with the lowest number is listed first and the probes are given pter to qter.
             • Probes on the same chromosome are written in the order from pter to qter as they appear on the
                 chromosome being described.
        e.   When contig probes are used each locus may be separated by a single slant line (/) in the ISCN de-
             scription. Alternatively, a single probe within the contig may be given in the nomenclature with the
             complete contig composition described in the report text.
        f.   Fusion genes are not described using a double colon (::) in the in situ hybridization ISCN descrip-
             tion. However, they are described in the interpretive comment using a double colon (::) (e.g.,
             BCR::ABL1) (Bruford et al., 2021) while probe cocktails are described using a slant line (e.g.,
             ABL1/BCR).
        g.   Cell numbers are given in square brackets ([ ]) for all neoplastic samples and to describe constitu-
             tional mosaicism/chimerism.
        h.   Inclusion of the control probe, when present, is optional in the ISCN description if it has a normal
             signal pattern but inclusion is mandatory if the control probe has an abnormal signal pattern. Its in-
             clusion is preferred where it provides additional information, e.g., for sex determination.
        i.   Amplification (amp) can be used when there are too many signals to allow enumeration or where
             the number of signals or the ratio compared to the control meets the clinical criterion for gene am-
             plification in the disease under investigation.


7.2          Prophase/Metaphase in situ Hybridization (ish)

7.2.1        Principles and Rules

        a. Observations on normal metaphase chromosomes are expressed by the abbreviation ish followed
           by a space, then the chromosome number, chromosome arm, region, band, or subband location of
           the locus or loci tested. This is followed in parentheses by the designation of the probe(s) and their
           signal patterns as described in the examples below. The chromosome band description in this chap-
           ter is based on the GRCh38 for in-house probes and as stated by the manufacturer for commercial
           probes.
        b. Clones/cell lines in metaphase in situ hybridization are given largest to smallest and the normal cell line
           is listed last e.g., 47,XX,+12[20].ish del(17)(p13p13)(TP53)×1[17]/del(17)(TP53)×0[12]/17p13(TP53)
           ×2[13] (see Section 4.5.3).
        c. In sex determination and whole chromosome enumeration the abbreviated system (karyotype
           format) is used in which only the chromosome number is given in the ISCN description, e.g., ish
           X(DXZ1)×1[20]/X(DXZ1)×2[10] and ish 8(D8Z2)×3[5]/8(D8Z2)×2[5].
        d. When reporting normal metaphase results (see Sections 7.2.2, 7.2.6.1), including neoplasia (see
           Section 7.2.2), and in whole chromosome aneusomy (see Section 7.5).
           • A multiplication (×) sign and the number of signals seen is given outside the parenthesis when
                 the number of signals is the same for all probes.
           • The multiplication (×) sign and the number of signals is given inside the parentheses when the
                 copy number differs between probes on the same hybridization (see Section 7.2.2).


        98                   Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224       ISCN 2024
                             DOI: 10.1159/000538512
        e. When reporting abnormal metaphase results in situ hybridization observations on the structurally
           abnormal metaphase chromosome(s) are expressed using the abbreviation ish followed by a space
           and then the abbreviation of the type of structural abnormality, followed in separate parentheses by
           the chromosome(s), the breakpoint(s), the probes used, and their signal patterns.
           • The presence (+) or absence (–) of a locus is given within the same parentheses as the probe in
               the description of abnormal ish (see Section 7.2.3).
           • When the number of signals on an abnormal chromosome can be counted, it may be indicated
               by multiple plus (+) signs. Tandem duplication is designated by a double plus (++) sign. Non-
               tandem duplication is shown with a comma (,) separating the probes (see Sections 7.2.3 and
               7.2.4).
        f. In metaphase in situ hybridization probes in multiple hybridizations are reported in a single set of
           parentheses, described in the pter to qter orientation of the centromeric segment of the chromosome
           being studied.
        g. Breakpoints need not be given in the ish nomenclature unless their inclusion clarifies or refines the
           breakpoints given in the conventional karyotype. If in situ hybridization further clarifies the karyo-
           type and, in retrospect, the abnormality can be visualized with banding, the karyotype may be re-
           written to reflect this new information. If the abnormality is cryptic and cannot be visualized by
           banding, the abnormality should not be listed in the banded karyotype.
        h. Probes on different chromosomes involved in a structural rearrangement are separated using a semi-
           colon (;).
        i. Whole chromosome paints (wcp) are listed in the pter to qter orientation of the chromosome be-
           ing studied, e.g., ish t(2;17)(q32;q24)(wcp2+,AC005181+,wcp17+;wcp17+,AC005181+,wcp2+)
        j. If whole chromosome paints are used with telomeric and subtelomeric probes, the telomeric probe
           is designated as the most terminal, followed by the whole chromosome paint and then the subtelo-
           meric probe when writing the nomenclature description from pter to qter.


7.2.2       Normal Signal Pattern

            i.    ish 17p11.2(RAI1)×2
                  Metaphase in situ hybridization shows a normal signal number for the RAI1 locus specific probe on chromosome
                  17.

            ii.   46,XX.ish X(DXZ1×2,SRY×0)
                  Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. Metaphase in situ hybridization confirms the sex chromosome com-
                  plement. Probes for the X centromere and the SRY gene are used, and SRY is not detected. Where the clinical ques-
                  tion is whether SRY is present or not, it is appropriate to indicate the status in the nomenclature. Note: the band
                  location of SRY is not given in the ISCN description because the Y chromosome is not present.

            iii. 46,XY.ish X(DXZ1)×1,Y(SRY,DYZ3)×1
                  Karyotype shows no abnormality in a male. Metaphase in situ hybridization confirms the sex chromosome comple-
                  ment. Note: the band locations are not given on the X and Y chromosomes in the abbreviated system
                  (karyotype format) when the assay is used for enumeration of the sex chromosome complement.

            iv. 46,XY.ish 4p16.3(NSD2/D4S166)×2
                  Karyotype shows no abnormality in the father of a child with der(4)t(4;11)(p16.3;p15). Metaphase in situ hybrid-
                  ization shows no abnormality with a probe for the critical region of Wolf-Hirschorn syndrome (NSD2/D4S166
                  probe) and a control probe, CTC-963K6. Note: the result for the control probe need not be given where the result
                  is normal.

            v.    46,XY.ish 22q11.2(D22S75)×2
                  Karyotype shows no abnormality in a male. Metaphase in situ hybridization using a probe in the 22q11.2 deletion
                  syndrome region (D22S75) shows a normal hybridization pattern. The control probe is not given.

              vi. 46,XX.ish 17p11.2(RAI1)×2,21q22.13(D21S259/D21S341/D21S342)×2
                    Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. Probes for the RAI1 gene on chromosome 17 and the Down syndrome
                    critical region on chromosome 21 are both present in the normal copy number (two copies) by in situ hybridization.
                    All loci of the contig probe are listed in this example.

              vii. 46,XY.ish 13(D13Z1/D21Z1)×2,21(D13Z1/D21Z1)×2
                    Karyotype shows no abnormality in a male. In situ hybridization with probes for the alpha satellites of chromosomes
                    13/21 shows a normal pattern. Note: in situ hybridization testing cannot differentiate the alpha satellite regions of
                    chromosomes 13 and 21 because of sequence homology.

              viii. ish 13(D13S319,LAMP1)×2[10]
                    In situ hybridization shows no evidence of loss of D13S319 and LAMP1 probes on chromosome 13 in a neoplastic
                    sample.

              ix. 46,XX[20].ish 13q14(D13S319)×2[10],14q32(IGH)×2[10],16q23(MAF)×2[10]
                    Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows no abnormality in a female with a normal in situ hybridization pattern for
                    the D13S319, IGH and MAF probes on metaphase chromosomes.



7.2.3         Abnormal Signal Pattern with a Single Probe

              In the following metaphase in situ hybridization examples either the clinically relevant probe or the
              informative control probe has an abnormal signal pattern.
              i.    46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.23q11.23)(ELN–,D7S486/D7S522+)
                    Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. An interstitial deletion in the Williams syndrome region of chromo-
                    some 7 is shown by in situ hybridization using a probe for the elastin gene (ELN). The control probe is given con-
                    firming that this is an interstitial, rather than a terminal deletion.

              ii.   46,XX.ish del(22)(q11.2q11.2)(D22S75–,ARSA+)
                    Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. An interstitial deletion within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome critical
                    region on chromosome 22 is shown by in situ hybridization using a probe for D22S75. The control probe ARSA
                    shows a normal signal pattern, confirming that this is an interstitial, rather than a terminal deletion.

              iii. ish del(22)(q11.2q11.2)(N25–,ARSA+)
                    Karyotype has not been performed. An interstitial deletion in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome critical region on
                    chromosome 22 is shown by in situ hybridization using a probe for N25. The control probe shows a normal signal
                    pattern, confirming that this is an interstitial, rather than a terminal deletion.

              iv. ish del(22)(q13.13q13.3 or q13.3)(D22S75+,ARSA–)
                    In situ hybridization using a probe to the ARSA gene shows loss of distal 22q. In this situation, the D22S75 probe
                    is the control probe and is given as it helps to define the extent of the deletion. Further testing may be required to
                    establish whether the deletion is terminal or interstitial.

              v.    46,XX,ins(2)(p13q21q31).ish ins(2)(wcp2+)
                    Karyotype shows an intrachromosomal insertion on chromosome 2 in a female. The long arm segment of chromo-
                    some 2 from 2q21 to 2q31 is inserted into the short arm of the same chromosome at band 2p13. The chromosome
                    2 origin of the inserted segment is confirmed by metaphase in situ hybridization using chromosome 2 whole chro-
                    mosome paint.

              vi. 46,XX.ish der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.?3;p11.?2)(SRY+,DXZ1+)
                    Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. Metaphase in situ hybridization shows a cryptic unbalanced translo-
                    cation between the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes with translocation of the SRY probe to Xp22, most
                    likely at Xp22.3. The probable breakpoints are given in the in situ hybridization ISCN description since the trans-
                    location is cryptic on karyotype. Note: the der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2) is a known recurrent rearrangement.




        100                      Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                 ISCN 2024
                                 DOI: 10.1159/000538512
    vii. 46,XX.ish der(X)ins(X;Y)(p22.?3;p11.?2p11.?2)(SRY+,DXZ1+) or der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.?3;p11.?2)
         (SRY+,DXZ1+)
         The same example as above, however, the distinction between a translocation or insertion as a mechanism has not
         been made.

    viii. 46,XX.ish der(7)ins(7;Y)(q22;p11.?2p11.?2)(SRY+)
         Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. In situ hybridization shows that the SRY probe is present on one
         chromosome 7, in band 7q22, by DAPI banding analysis. As the rearrangement is cryptic, the subbands of the in-

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows a translocation involving chromosomes 2 and 17 in a female. Metaphase
         in situ hybridization shows that the translocation disrupts 17q24.3, corresponding to BAC clone AC005181, result-
         ing in a probe signal on both derivative chromosomes. Note: the in situ hybridization further clarifies the 17q break-
         point although this is not visible on G-banding.

         Karyotype shows a supernumerary marker chromosome in a male. Metaphase in situ hybridization, using an alpha
         satellite probe for chromosome 8, shows that the marker is derived, at least in part, from chromosome 8. Breakpoints
         could not be determined, and the composition of the derivative chromosome could not be elucidated fully.

    xi. 46,XY.ish dup(17)(p11.2p11.2)(RAI1++)
         An apparently normal male karyotype. Metaphase in situ hybridization shows a tandem duplication of the region
         containing the RAI1 gene on chromosome 17. There is one probe signal in the homologous chromosome 17, not
         indicated in the ISCN description.

         An apparently normal female karyotype in a neoplastic sample. In situ hybridization shows a cryptic inversion of
         the segment 21q11.2 to 21q22.1 using a probe for the RUNX1 gene. Note: the inversion breakpoints are given in
         separate parentheses to clarify the inversion.

         Karyotype has not been performed. Metaphase in situ hybridization with a probe for the D22S75 locus shows an
         interstitial deletion within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome critical region in both chromosomes 22. Note: the pres-
         ence of the control probe determines that the losses are interstitial. It is optional to use underlining (_) to differen-
         tiate between the two homologues.

    xiv. 47,XX,+mar.ish mar(Acro-p+)
         Karyotype shows a supernumerary marker chromosome in a female. In situ hybridization using the Acro-p probe
         shows that the marker chromosome has a single acrocentric short arm region derived from an acrocentric chromo-
         some of unknown origin.

    xv. 47,XY,+mar.ish mar(Acro-p+,Acro-p+)
         Karyotype shows a male karyotype with a supernumerary marker chromosome. In situ hybridization using the
         Acro-p probe shows a probe signal on both ends of the marker chromosome. The marker chromosome is bisatel-
         lited and derived from an acrocentric chromosome(s) of unknown origin.

         Karyotype shows a balanced direct insertion of a chromosome 2 segment into the short arm of chromosome 5.
         Metaphase in situ hybridization using chromosome 2 whole chromosome paint confirmed the presence of the chro-
         mosome 2 segment.

                    Karyotype shows material of unknown origin replacing distal chromosome 4 from band 4q31 to 4qter. In situ hy-
                    bridization using a whole chromosome paint 4 shows that the proximal part of the additional material is derived
                    from chromosome 4. Conventional karyotype review in conjunction with the in situ hybridization result suggests a
                    duplication of the bands 4q31 to probably 4q34. However, there is additional material distal to the duplication which
                    does not hybridize with whole chromosome 4 paint and is therefore of unknown origin. Note: the karyotype could
                    be rewritten to reflect the in situ hybridization information.

                    Karyotype shows a female with a single X chromosome, and a ring chromosome of unknown origin. The ring chro-
                    mosome is shown to be derived from the X chromosome by in situ hybridization using a whole X chromosome
                    paint and an alpha satellite probe, DXZ1. The breakpoints of the ring could not be determined.

                    Karyotype shows a duplication in the short arm of chromosome 5 from 5p15.3 to 5p14 in a female. Metaphase in
                    situ hybridization shows a non-tandem duplication where one of the D5S721/D5S23+ probe signals is present near
                    the telomere and the other is more centromeric. As the duplication is non-tandem the probes are separated by a
                    comma in the ISCN description. There is one signal on the homologous chromosome 5, not indicated in the ISCN
                    description.

                    and the chromosome 16 alpha satellite probe (D16Z2) show that the marker is derived in part from chromosome
                    16. Additional material of unknown origin is present in the marker.

              vi. 47,XY,+mar.ish der(17)(wcp17+,D17Z1+)
                    Karyotype shows a supernumerary marker chromosome in a male. The chromosome 17 whole chromosome paint
                    and a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite probe (D17Z1) show that the marker is derived from chromosome 17.

                    Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows no abnormality in a female. A cryptic insertion of the segment 17q21 from
                    the long arm of chromosome 17 into the 15q24.1 band of the long arm of chromosome 15 is shown using in situ
                    hybridization with the dual-color, dual-fusion PML/RARA probe set. The breakpoint on chromosome 17 is within
                    the RARA probe resulting in a signal on the derivative chromosome 15 and on the derivative chromosome 17.

                  the original orientation. The duplicated chromosome contains two copies of the region covered by the RP11–1076P8
                  BAC probe at 4p16.3, and a probe for the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region in the original orientation
                  relative to 4pter. Note: the order of probes is given according to their relative position pter to qter on the deriva-
                  tive chromosome.

                  Karyotype shows extra material replacing the distal short arm of one chromosome 4 from 4p16.3 in a female. In
                  situ hybridization using a whole chromosome paint 4 shows that the extra chromatin is derived from chromosome
                  4. The additional material is determined to be an inverted duplication involving 4p16.3 by in situ hybridization. The
                  duplicated chromosome contains two copies of the region covered by the RP11–1076P8 BAC probe and a probe
                  for the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region. The duplicated region is in the reverse orientation relative to

                  bridization using subtelomeric probes shows a translocation of the chromosome 11 long arm subtelomeric probe,
                  RP11–469N6, to the long arm of chromosome 6, and of the chromosome 6 long arm subtelomeric probe, RP11–

                  Metaphase in situ hybridization shows two clones. A balanced translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18 pres-
                  ent in 20 metaphases and a second clone with deletion of the derivative chromosome 14 in a further ten metaphas-

                  Karyotype shows no abnormality in a female. An enhanced signal is observed at band 17p11.2 by metaphase in situ
                  hybridization using the RAI1 probe. The probe signal appears larger on one chromosome 17 compared to the probe
                  signal on the homologous chromosome 17.

                  Karyotype shows deletion of the short arm of the X chromosome in a female. The in situ hybridization signals of
                  BAC clones RP11–265P11 (Xp11.4) and RP1–112K5 (Xp11.22) are consistently less intense on the deleted X
                  chromosome than on the normal homologue, indicating that part of each probe region is deleted and therefore iden-
                  tifying the proximal and distal breakpoints respectively. Note: the karyotype breakpoints have not been changed
                  due to the lower level of resolution of the banded chromosomes.



7.2.6       Subtelomeric Metaphase in situ Hybridization

            Subtelomeric in situ hybridization may be performed in panels so that the 41 unique chromosome
            ends are hybridized simultaneously.

7.2.6.1         Normal Signal Pattern


                A normal result using a subtelomeric in situ hybridization panel is given using the short system
                (karyotype format), for example:
                i.    ish (subtel41)×2
                      Metaphase in situ hybridization shows a normal result with probes to the 41 subtelomeric regions.

                      Targeted metaphase in situ hybridization shows two copies of the subtelomeric regions of 1p and 4p representing
                      a normal finding in a relative of a translocation carrier.

                      Metaphase in situ hybridization confirms a balanced translocation between the distal long arm of chromosome 13
                      and the distal short arm of chromosome 20 using the 13q subtelomere probe, 163C9, and the 20p subtelomere probe,

                      13 and the distal short arm of chromosome 20. The subtelomeric region of 13q (163C9 probe) is deleted and re-
                      placed with the subtelomeric region of 20p (dj1061L1 probe).

                      Karyotype shows a recombinant chromosome 4 derived from a maternal pericentric inversion of chromosome 4.
                      Metaphase in situ hybridization confirms the recombinant chromosome 4. There is a duplication of 4pter to 4p16.1
                      seen with the D4S3359 probe, and a deletion from 4q35 to 4qter seen with the D4S2930 probe. For explanation of
                      the inheritance nomenclature see Section 4.2.1.




7.2.7           Multicolor Chromosome Painting

                Multicolor FISH banding and 24 color karyotyping are techniques used to paint chromosomes with
                a distinct color or spectrum of colors. They can be used as a tool to clarify the G-banded analysis.
                The karyotype can be rewritten based on the knowledge gained from the results of these techniques.
                The use of these techniques should be stated in the report. Nomenclature for wcp (see Sections 7.2.1,
                7.2.3 and 7.2.4) may be used.


7.2.8           Partial Chromosome Painting

                Probes that are band specific or arm specific can be used as partial chromosome paints (pcp). The
                nomenclature is similar to that of wcp (see Sections 7.2.1, 7.2.3 and 7.2.4).
                i.    46,XX,?dup(18)(p11.3p11.2).ish dup(18)(pcp18p+)
                      Karyotype shows a suspected tandem duplication on 18p that is confirmed by in situ hybridization using a partial
                      chromosome paint for 18p.

                ii.   46,XY,inv(8)(p21q13).ish inv(8)(pcp8p+,pcp8p+)
                      Karyotype shows an inversion of chromosome 8 that is confirmed by in situ hybridization using a partial chromo-
                      some paint for 8p.

                 for Xp and Xq to consist of short and long arm material of the X chromosome. The X chromosome pericentromer-
                 ic region is identified by DXZ1 and the presence of XIST is confirmed by use of the gene probe.




7.3         Interphase/Nuclear in situ Hybridization (nuc ish)

7.3.1       Principles and Rules

        a. Interphase in situ hybridization (nuc ish) includes the number of signals and their positions rela-
           tive to each other.
        b. See also Section 7.1.1 for general rules and principles that also apply for nuc ish.
        c. In ISCN 2024 the chromosome band location is not included in the nuc ish ISCN description as the
           physical chromosome location cannot be seen in interphase nuclei as there are no chromosome
           bands.
        d. To indicate the number of signals in interphase nuclei, the abbreviation nuc ish is followed by a
           space and then the probe designation in parentheses, a multiplication (×) sign, and the number of
           signals seen.
        e. If probes for two or more loci are used in the same hybridization, they follow one another in a single
           set of parentheses, separated by a comma (,), and a multiplication (×) sign outside the parenthesis
           if the copy number is the same for all probes, and inside the parenthesis when the number of signals
           differs between probes.
        f. Results from different hybridizations are presented in separate sets of parentheses even if all show
           a normal signal pattern.
        g. The probes from the same chromosome number are listed from pter to qter according to their nor-
           mal chromosome location, and are separated by a comma (,).
        h. For a single locus with probes at the 5′ and 3′ end of a gene, the probes should be listed as they re-
           side on the normal chromosome from pter to qter and separated by a comma (,). The chromosome
           order of 5′ and 3′ probes may need to be verified from the manufacturers’ data sheet.
        i. Separation of colocalized or adjacent probes is indicated by the abbreviation (sep). Probes that be-
           come connected (conjoined) because of genomic rearrangement are indicated using the abbreviation
           (con).
        j. The double colon (::) is not used in the nuc ish ISCN description to indicate fusion gene formation.
        k. The number of nuclei analyzed is given in square brackets ([ ]) after the ISCN description in all
           neoplastic studies and in mosaic constitutional studies and is not given where non-mosaic results
           are observed in constitutional studies.
        l. When normal and abnormal nuclei are found, the number of abnormal nuclei is listed over the total
           number of nuclei analyzed (the denominator) for each abnormal probe. Normal nuclei are not listed
           as it is implied that they are the remainder of the total. The exception to this rule is in the determi-
           nation of the sex chromosome complement of an individual where the normal cell line is listed last.
           In this situation the total number of nuclei reported is equal to the denominator (see Section 7.3.3.1).
        m. Caveats of techniques, for example the semi-quantitative nature of interphase in situ hybridization
           in tissue sections or the design of a particular probe, are not indicated in the nomenclature and should
           be stated in the interpretive text of the report.

                    are scored, and the signal patterns are the same. Reporting of the LAMP1 control probe is optional but may be pre-
                    ferred in neoplastic studies to confirm chromosome copy number.

                   100 nuclei. It is not critical to include the control probe (LAMP1) in the ISCN description, but it is included here
                   to confirm chromosome 13 copy number.

                   is gain of a signal for D12Z3 in 50 nuclei. A normal signal pattern is shown in 150 interphase nuclei. Note: D13S319,
                   LAMP1 and TP53 probes each show a normal hybridization pattern in 200 nuclei. The LAMP1 control probe is
                   included in the ISCN description as it is informative regarding chromosome 13 copy number.

                   pattern.




7.3.3.1       Order of Cell Lines and Clones in nuc ish


          a. Abnormal cell lines and clones detected by in situ hybridization are listed from largest to smallest
             number of nuclei. The exception is that the normal cell line is listed last when it is given to show the
             sex chromosome complement.
          b. Where two or more abnormal cell lines/clones are present in equal numbers their order of listing
             is determined by the following rules (shown in order of application):
             • Where the abnormality in different cell lines/clones involves probes on different chromosomes
                 then the chromosome order rule applies (X before Y) followed by autosomes in increasing
                 number.
             • Where the abnormality in different cell lines/clones involves the same probe on the same chro-
                 mosome then the gain before loss before structural change rule applies.
             • Where the same type of abnormality in different cell lines/clones involves different probes on
                 the same chromosome then the pter to qter rule applies.
             • Where different abnormal signal patterns are present in an equal number of nuclei for the same
                 probe set, the least complex cell line/clone is described first.

                   Interphase in situ hybridization shows a single DXZ1 signal in 12 nuclei, and six nuclei show one DXZ1 and two
                   DYZ3 signals. There is one signal for each of DXZ1 and DYZ3 in 32 nuclei. Note: for sex chromosome mosaicism,
                   an exception is made to include the cell line with the normal complement (XY), and this cell line is listed last. The
                   sum of the numerators is equal to the denominator in this example because the results of the normal cell line are
                   included.

      ii.   nuc ish (D5S630,EGR1)×1[100/200]/(D5S630×2,EGR1×1)[50/200]
            Interphase in situ hybridization shows two clones in a neoplastic sample: a concomitant loss of the EGR1 signal
            and the D5S630 control probe (5p15) signal in 100 interphase nuclei, consistent with monosomy 5, and loss of only
            the EGR1 signal, consistent with a deletion of 5q, in 50 nuclei. A normal signal pattern for these probes is present
            in 50 nuclei. Note: the larger clone is listed first even though it likely evolved from the smaller clone.

      iii. nuc ish (D5S630×2,EGR1×1)[150/250]/(D5S630,EGR1)×1[100/250]
            Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows a signal pattern that is consistent with deletion of 5q
            in 150 interphase nuclei, and a signal pattern consistent with monosomy 5 in 100 nuclei. There are no nuclei with
            a normal signal pattern. Note: the larger clone is listed first.

      iv. nuc ish (D5S630,EGR1)×1[50/200]/(D5S630×2,EGR1×1)[50/200]
            Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows equal numbers of interphase nuclei with signal pat-
            terns indicating loss of D5S630 at 5p15.31 and loss of EGR1 at 5q31.2 in one clone and loss of EGR1 only in the
            second clone. There is insufficient information regarding chromosome structure to indicate whether the first clone
            represents a deletion in both chromosome arms, or whether it represents monosomy 5. A normal signal pattern is
            present in the remaining 100 nuclei. Note: since the number of cells are equal, the clone with the altered probe pat-
            tern closest to pter is listed first.

      v.    nuc ish (D5S630×2,EGR1×3)[50/200]/(D5S630,EGR1)×1[50/200]/(D5S630×2,EGR1×1)[50/200]
            Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows three clones of equal size: 50 nuclei with gain of
            EGR1 at 5q31.2, and 50 nuclei with loss of D5S630 (5p15.31) and loss of EGR1. Fifty nuclei with loss of EGR1,
            and 50 nuclei show a normal signal pattern. There is insufficient structural information to determine whether the
            chromosome losses shown by in situ hybridization are simple deletions or more complex chromosome rearrange-
            ments. Note: the clone with EGR1 gain is given before the clones with EGR1 loss. Following the pter to qter rule,
            the clone with loss of D5S630 and EGR1 is given next, followed by the clone with loss of only EGR1.

      vi. nuc ish (ATM×1,TP53×2)[100/200]/(ATM×2,TP53×1)[100/200]
            Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows two clones of equal size. Each has a single abnormal
            probe pattern. In this case the clone with loss of ATM is listed before that with loss of TP53 because they are listed
            in chromosome order for the abnormal probes.

      vii. nuc ish (D13S319×1,LAMP1×2)[55/200]/(D13S319×2,LAMP1×1)[55/200]
            Interphase in situ hybridization in this neoplastic sample shows two clones of equal size. The signal pattern in one
            clone is consistent with an interstitial loss within 13q14.3 (D13S319×1,LAMP1×2) and in the other clone, the sig-
            nal pattern is consistent with an apparently terminal deletion involving 13q34 (D13S319×2,LAMP1×1). A normal
            signal pattern is present in 90 nuclei. Note: where two clones of equal size have the same number of abnormal pat-
            terns affecting the same chromosome then the clone with the abnormality closest to pter is listed before the clone
            with abnormality of a more distal probe.

      viii. nuc ish (D13S319×0,LAMP1×2)[100/200]/(D13S319×1,LAMP1×2)[50/200]
            Homozygous deletion of D13S319 at 13q14.3 is detected in 100 of 200 nuclei by interphase in situ hybridization
            of a neoplastic sample. A heterozygous deletion is seen in 50 nuclei and the remaining 50 nuclei show a normal
            signal pattern. Note: the larger clone is given first, even though the smaller clone in this example is likely to rep-
            resent the stem line. The result of the control probe, LAMP1, is given to demonstrate that the first clone represents
            homozygous interstitial deletion rather than nullisomy for chromosome 13.

      ix. nuc ish (D13S319×1,LAMP1×2)[100/200]/(D13S319×0,LAMP1×2)[100/200]
            In situ hybridization shows two clones of equal size in a neoplastic sample. Heterozygous deletion of D13S319 at
            13q14.3 is detected in 100 nuclei and a homozygous deletion is also seen in 100 nuclei. There are no nuclei with a
            normal signal pattern. Note: different signal patterns are present in an equal number of nuclei for the same probe
            set, both represent loss and so the least complex clone is given first.

            a. To indicate relative signal positions in the interphase nucleus, the result is given in two sets of pa-
               rentheses, one following immediately after the other.
            b. The total number of signals is given in the first set of parentheses and the relative position of the

                     This is a normal result for in situ hybridization in a female. The hybridization signals for the KAL1 probe (ANOS1)
                     and STS probe signals are normally adjacent because of close physical association of the respective loci (ANOS1
                     and STS) on the X chromosome. There is a normal signal pattern of two signals for each probe in a female.

                     STS probe signal are separated, presumably by chromosomal rearrangement and the other signals show the normal
                     juxtaposition.

                     in a neoplastic sample. The ABL1 and BCR genes reside on two separate chromosomes and rearrangement is not
                     apparent in 200 nuclei. The expected copy number for each (×2) is given. Note: the ABL1 probe is listed before
                     the BCR probe because they are listed in chromosome order.

                        an abnormal pattern in 200 nuclei. There are three signals for each probe. There are two conjoined ABL1 and BCR
                        probe signals, consistent with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and formation of the
                        BCR::ABL1 fusion gene and the reciprocal ABL1::BCR. Note: signals associated with BCR::ABL1 and ABL1::BCR
                        are indistinguishable using this probe set.

                        an atypical rearrangement resulting one conjoined BCR/ABL1/BCR signal in 100 nuclei. This signal pattern could
                        occur if 3′ABL1 is inserted into BCR. RT-PCR for the BCR::ABL1 chimeric transcript is recommended. There are

                        one conjoined ABL1 and BCR signal, most likely representing the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene, one isolated ABL1
                        signal and one isolated BCR signal. This hybridization pattern is consistent with loss of, most likely, the reciprocal
                        ABL1::BCR fusion signal in 100 nuclei.

         The isolated 3′BCL6 probe signal may be evidence of an interstitial deletion or unbalanced rearrangement involv-
         ing the BCL6 gene. There are three MYC probe signals identified using both a single break-apart MYC probe and
         a dual-color, dual-fusion MYC/IGH probe set. The IGH probe shows two to four signals. There is one normal BCL2
         probe signal (with 3′ and 5′ components connected), one to two isolated 3′BCL2 probe signals and one isolated
         5′BCL2 probe signal. Note: ranges of signal number may be given to simplify otherwise complex results, e.g.,

         fusion ABL1/BCR probe set shows conjoined ABL1 and BCR signals that are consistent with BCR::ABL1 fusion
         gene formation in 120 interphase nuclei. A further 120 interphase nuclei in the same hybridization show gain of
         conjoined ABL1 and BCR signals, and 90 nuclei show a normal signal pattern for the ABL1 and BCR probes. There
         is also gain of an IGH signal in 90 of 200 nuclei scored. All other probes show a normal signal pattern. Note: probes
         are listed in chromosome order and where different abnormal signal patterns are present in an equal number of nu-
         clei for the same probe set the least complex clone is described first.

         Karyotype of a neoplastic sample shows no abnormality. Metaphase in situ hybridization shows a normal result for
         two probes on chromosome 13 (DLEU and LAMP1) and a normal result for the dual-color, dual-fusion IGH/MAF
         probe set. Interphase in situ hybridization identified a small clone with an interstitial 13q deletion involving 13q14,
         and a clone of similar size with conjoining of IGH and MAF probe signals. Note: metaphases of the neoplastic
         clone(s) are not observed, and the clones are identified only by interphase in situ hybridization.

            a. The normal signal pattern for break-apart probes is given using the probe designation without indi-
               cating the 5′ and 3′ components. For these probes the normal situation is the presence of two fusion
               signals.
            b. For abnormal results, the total number of probe signals is given in the first set of parentheses and
               the relative position of the 5′ and 3′ signals to one another using (sep) and (con) is given in the sec-
               ond set of parentheses.

                        it is acknowledged that the break-apart probes consist of a 5′ and a 3′ region.

                        rated into the 5′KMT2A probe and the 3′ KMT2A probe components, presumably because of a translocation in-

                        ably because of a deletion involving 3′KMT2A or because there is a translocation resulting in 5′KMT2A-3′ partner

                Metaphase in situ hybridization confirms an isoderivative chromosome 21 with duplication of 21q22 identified in
                a neoplastic sample. There are two signals for the RUNX1 probe in each arm of the isoderivative chromosome.
                Note: a comma between the two probes in the ISCN description indicates that they are non-tandem (see Section
                7.2.1).

          iv. ish ider(21)(q10)add(21)(q11.2)(RUNX1amp,RUNX1amp)[3]
                An isochromosome derived from chromosome 21 with additional uncharacterized material in a neoplastic sample.
                Metaphase in situ hybridization shows an increase in RUNX1 probe signals fulfilling the clinical definition of
                RUNX1 amplification. There is amplification of RUNX1 on each chromosome arm.

          v.    ish der(21)(RUNX1)amp[4]
                Metaphase in situ hybridization shows that a derivative chromosome 21 in a neoplastic sample has an increase in
                RUNX1 probe signals so numerous that they cannot be quantified in the four metaphases analyzed.

          vi. nuc ish (MYCN)×12~>20[200]
                Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows 12 to more than 20 MYCN probe signals in 200 nu-
                clei. A control probe, D2Z1, is also used and its inclusion is optional in the ISCN description as the MYCN probe
                is informative.

          vii. nuc ish (MYCN)amp[200]
                Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows several MYCN probe signals too large to be quanti-
                fied. A control probe, D2Z1, is also used, but is not included in the ISCN description as the MYCN probe signal
                pattern is informative.

          viii. nuc ish (D17Z1,ERBB2)×4~5[100/200]
                Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows four to five signals for the D17Z1 and ERBB2 probes
                in 100 of 200 nuclei. The control probe is given in the ISCN description as it confirms polysomy for chromosome
                17. No abnormality is detected in 100 nuclei.

            ix. nuc ish (D17Z1×2,ERBB2×10~20)[100/200]
                  Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows ten to 20 ERBB2 probe signals in 100 nuclei and two
                  signals for the alpha satellite 17 probe, D17Z1. The control probe is given in the ISCN description as it confirms
                  there are only two copies of chromosome 17. No abnormality is detected in 100 nuclei.

            x.    nuc ish (D17Z1×2~3,ERBB2amp)[100/200]/(D17Z1,ERBB2)×3[20/200]
                  Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows copy gain of D17Z1 and amplification of ERBB2
                  probe signals. In addition, three signals each for both D17Z1 and ERBB2 are seen in 20 nuclei and two signals for
                  each observed in 80 nuclei.

            xi. nuc ish (D17Z1,ERBB2)amp[156/200]/(D17Z1,ERBB2)×4[20/200]
                  Interphase in situ hybridization of a neoplastic sample shows signal amplification of the D17Z1 and ERBB2 probes.
                  Four D17Z1 and ERBB2 probe signals are observed in 20 nuclei and the remaining 24 nuclei show the normal two
                  signals for each probe.




7.5         Enumeration Probes

            For enumeration probes the abbreviated system (karyotype format) is used (see Section 4.7).
            i.    ish 8(D8Z2)×3[20]/8(D8Z2)×2[30]
                  Metaphase in situ hybridization in a prenatal sample shows three signals for the chromosome 8 pericentromeric
                  alpha satellite probe, D8Z2, in 20 metaphases and two signals for this probe in 30 metaphases. These results are
                  consistent with mosaic trisomy chromosome 8.

            ii.   ish 8(D8Z2)×3[25]/8(D8Z2)×2[25].nuc ish (D8Z2)×3[52/100]
                  In situ hybridization shows three D8Z2 probe signals in 25 metaphases and two D8Z2 probe signals in another 25
                  metaphases; interphase in situ hybridization confirms the presence of an extra D8Z2 probe signal in 52 of 100 nu-
                  clei of this neoplastic specimen. These results are consistent with a clone with trisomy 8.

            iii. 45,X[3]/46,XY[12].ish X(DXZ1×1,SRY×0)[32]/X(DXZ1)×1,Y(SRY)×1[68]
                  Karyotype shows two cell lines in a male: one cell line with 45,X and the other with an apparently normal male
                  karyotype. For determining the sex chromosome complement, it is appropriate to indicate the status of SRY in both
                  cell lines. The cell line with a single X chromosome is confirmed by metaphase in situ hybridization to have no
                  signals for SRY. The 46,XY cell line is confirmed to have a single X chromosome and one appropriately located
                  SRY gene on the Y chromosome. A multiplication (×) sign is used instead of plus (+) sign as this is a normal sig-
                  nal pattern for the single X chromosome. Note: the normal cell line is listed last.

            iv. nuc ish (DXZ1×2,DYZ3×1,D18Z1×3),(RB1,D21S259/D21S341/D21S342)×3
                or
                nuc ish (DXZ1×2,DYZ3×1,D18Z1×3),(RB1,D21S259)×3
                  Interphase in situ hybridization shows two probe signals for the X chromosome, one probe signal for the Y chro-
                  mosome, and three probe signals for chromosomes 13, 18 and 21. This finding is consistent with a triploid result,
                  69,XXY. Note: the chromosome 21 probe contig shows each probe listed, separated by slant lines in the first ex-
                  ample. In the second example a description of the other chromosome 21 contig probes must be given in the text of
                  the report.




7.6         Mosaic and Chimera Signal Pattern

            For general rules concerning reporting mosaicism and chimerism and for an explanation of the use
            of double slant line (//) in chimeras, see Section 4.5.3.
            i.    nuc ish (DXZ1)×2[400]//
                  Interphase in situ hybridization shows 400 nuclei all representing the female recipient post sex-mismatched stem
                  cell transplant. No donor nuclei are detected.




      118                      Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224              ISCN 2024
                               DOI: 10.1159/000538512
    ii.   //nuc ish (DXZ1,DYZ3)×1[400]
          Interphase in situ hybridization shows 400 nuclei all representing the male donor post sex-mismatched allogeneic
          stem cell transplant. No recipient nuclei are detected.

    iii. nuc ish (DXZ1)×2[50]//(DXZ1,DYZ3)×1[350]
          Interphase in situ hybridization using X and Y alpha satellite probes shows 50 recipient XX nuclei and 350 donor
          XY nuclei post sex-mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplant.

    iv. nuc ish (DXZ1)×2[50]/(DXZ1×1,DYZ3×0)[10]//(DXZ1,DYZ3)×1[300] or (DXZ1)×2[50]//
        (DXZ1,DYZ3)×1[300]/(DXZ1×1,DYZ3×0)[10]
          Interphase in situ hybridization using X and Y alpha satellite probes shows 50 recipient XX nuclei and 300 donor
          XY nuclei post sex-mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplant. Ten nuclei with a single X chromosome are de-
          tected. The origin of the single X chromosome cell line is unknown and could be derived from either the recipient
          XX (shown in the first option) or donor XY (shown in the second option) cell line. Note: the smallest cell line is
          listed last for recipient and donor.

    v.    mos 46,X,+r[15]/45,X[10].ish r(X)(wcpX+,DXZ1+)[10]
          Karyotype shows two cell lines in a female: one with 46 chromosomes including a small ring chromosome and
          another cell line with 45,X. Metaphase in situ hybridization using the whole X chromosome paint and the X alpha
          satellite probe, shows that the ring chromosome is derived from the X chromosome.

    vi. 46,X,+r.ish r(X)(wcpX+,DXZ1+)[15]/r(X)(wcpX+,DXZ1+,DXZ1+)[10]
          Karyotype shows a cell line with a single X chromosome and a small ring chromosome. Metaphase in situ hybrid-
          ization with a whole X chromosome paint shows that the ring is derived from the X chromosome. Probe DXZ1, for
          the X alpha satellite, shows the ring to be monocentric in some metaphases and dicentric in other metaphases. Note:
          if the non-tandem duplication of the DXZ1+ signal pattern is due to dynamic mosaicism then it is not reported in
          the ISCN description.

    vii. ish del(14)(q21.2q21.2)(RP11–453F20–)dn[6]/14q21.2(RP11–453F20)×2[4]
          Metaphase in situ hybridization using a locus specific probe, RP11–453F20 confirms a de novo cryptic deletion
          within band 14q21.2 in six of the ten metaphases. This deletion had originally been identified by microarray.

    viii. ish del(14)(q21.2q21.2)(RP11–453F20–)dn[16]/dup(14)(14q21.2q21.2)(RP11–453F20++)mat[4]
          Metaphase in situ hybridization using a locus specific probe, RP11–453F20 confirms a de novo cryptic deletion
          within band 14q21.2 in 16 of 20 metaphases, and a duplication within band 14q21.2, inherited from the mother, in
          four of the 20 metaphases. The abnormality of this subband has previously been identified by microarray.

    ix. 47,XX,+mar[10]/46,XX[20].ish der(15)(:p11.2→q11.2:)(D15S11+,SNRPN+,D15S10–,GABRB3–)[5]
        /15q11.2q12(D15S11,SNRPN,D15S10,GABRB3)×2[20]
          Karyotype shows mosaicism for a marker chromosome of unknown origin in a female. Metaphase in situ hybrid-
          ization identifies the marker as an abnormal chromosome 15 that includes the region defined by probes for D15S11
          (15q11.2) and the SNRPN (15q11.2) gene.

    x.    ish 21(D21S259/D21S341/D21S342)×3[20]/21(D21S259/D21S341/D21S342)×2[30]
          Metaphase in situ hybridization using a locus specific probe contig for chromosome 21, shows mosaicism in a
          female with three chromosomes 21, each with a single copy of the Down syndrome critical region in 20 of 50 meta-
          phases analyzed. All loci of the contig probe are listed in this example. Note: if all three signals for D21S259/
          D21S341/D21S342 are present on a single chromosome 21 the result will be ish der(21)(q22.13)(D21S259/
          D21S341/D21S342+++).

    xi. nuc ish chi (DXZ1,DYZ3)×1[32/50]/(DXZ1)×2[18/50]
          Interphase in situ hybridization shows one copy of the X chromosome and one copy of the Y chromosome in 32 of
          50 nuclei, and 18 nuclei with two copies of the X chromosome. This is consistent with a XY/XX chimera although
          further studies are needed for confirmation. The larger of the cell lines is listed first.

    xii. ish chi X(DXZ1)×2[5]/X(DXZ1)×1,Y(SRY)×1[5]
          Metaphase in situ hybridization using probes for DXZ1 and SRY in a chimeric individual shows two cell lines in
          five metaphases each, one cell line with two X chromosomes and the other with one X and one Y chromosome.
          The cell lines are given in chromosome order.

          Interphase in situ hybridization shows a signal pattern consistent with an XXY sex chromosome complement in
          150 of 200 nuclei and the remaining 50 nuclei show a signal pattern consistent with an XY sex chromosome com-
          plement. All nuclei scored show a normal result for RB1 and D18Z1 and are non-mosaic for trisomy 21. Note: cell

8.1           Introduction

              Chromosomal microarray is a genome-wide investigation for the detection of copy number change.
              In platforms that are supplemented with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes, zygosity
              and some forms of ploidy can be determined. Most microarray platforms cover only nonrepetitive



                                                Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224            121
                                                DOI: 10.1159/000538512
              regions. As such, the acrocentric short arms, centromeric and telomeric regions, and regions of het-
              erochromatin are not detected by microarray.
                  Positional structural chromosome information is not provided by this technology and elucida-
              tion of the nature of the underlying rearrangement by alternative methods such as conventional
              karyotype or FISH may be required.


8.1.1         General Principles

        a. For general cytogenomic rules that are also applicable to microarray, see Chapter 4. For targeted
           microarray result nomenclature, see Chapter 10.
        b. If no abnormality is detected by microarray, the results are expressed beginning with arr to desig-
           nate microarray, then a space followed by the opening parenthesis. Sex chromosomes are listed first,
           followed by a comma (,), before the autosomes and the closing parenthesis. This is followed by the
           multiplication (×) sign and the copy number. The genome build is only given if the nucleotide co-
           ordinates are reported (see Sections 4.4.5 and 8.2.1).
        c. An abnormal result in which nucleotide coordinates are given, is expressed beginning with arr to
           designate microarray, no space, the speciﬁed genome build (e.g., [GRCh38] referring to the
           Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 assembly) in square brackets ([ ]), then a space
           followed by chromosome band and nucleotides. Only the abnormal genomic regions are described.
           • The aberrations of sex chromosomes are listed first, followed by autosomes which are listed
                from lowest to highest number chromosome.
           • The nucleotides are listed within parentheses from pter to qter with an underscore (_), to in-
                dicate the segment between the listed nucleotides. This is followed by the multiplication (×)
                sign and copy number of the aberration.
           • Multiple aberrations are each separated by a comma (,). The nomenclature for reporting abnor-
                mal results is detailed in Section 4.4.
           • The normal sex chromosome complement is generally not given in the ISCN description for an
                autosomal abnormality, although if it is clinically relevant it should be included in the interpre-
                tive text.
           • When describing abnormalities involving sex chromosomes, the normal sex chromosome may
                be given for clarity.
        d. For interstitial deletions or duplications where both breakpoints are within the same chromosome
           band, the breakpoint band is given only once in the ISCN description.
        e. To indicate a mixed cell population, the proportion of cells with the aberration can be estimated from
           the fractional copy number and included in square brackets ([ ]) following the copy number. Al-
           ternatively, the range of copy numbers can be indicated using a tilde (∼).
        f. When mixed cell populations can be distinguished for constitutional and unrelated clones, the larg-
           est cell line/clone is listed first. For related clones in neoplasia, the least complex clone is listed
           first.
        g. In neoplastic samples the proportion of the sample with each abnormality is given in square
           brackets ([ ]) when the abnormality is detected at less than 100% of the sample. When the abnor-
           mality is apparently present in 100% of the sample, then it is optional to include [1.0].
        h. The proportion of the sample with an abnormality is estimated from the profile and is not adjusted
           for the tumor load.
        i. Three systems are used in the microarray format (see Section 4.7.2):
           • The abbreviated system describes the abnormality/abnormalities without using the genome build
                and nucleotides.
           • The short system includes the genome build, chromosome bands and nucleotides within the ab-
                normality.

                             DOI: 10.1159/000538512

8.2        Examples of Microarray Nomenclature

8.2.1      Normal Results

           i.    arr (X,1–22)×2
                 Microarray analysis shows no abnormality in a female profile.

           ii.   arr (X,Y) ×1,(1–22)×2
                 Microarray analysis shows no abnormality in a male profile.

           iii. arr (1–22)×2
                 Microarray analysis shows no abnormality in the sample and the sex chromosomes are undisclosed.

           iv. 46,U.arr (1–22)×2
                 The karyotype and microarray analysis show no abnormality. The sex chromosomes are undisclosed.



8.2.2      Abnormal Copy Number Results

           Structural chromosome information is not provided by this technology and elucidation of the nature
           of the rearrangement by alternative methods such as conventional karyotype or FISH may be neces-
           sary.

           i.    arr (X)×2,(Y)×1
                 Microarray analysis shows a male profile with two copies of an X chromosome and one Y chromosome. This find-
                 ing is consistent with Klinefelter syndrome.

           ii.   arr (X)×1,(Y)×2
                 Microarray analysis shows a male profile with a single X chromosome and gain of a Y chromosome. The normal
                 X chromosome is given in the ISCN description for clarity.

           iii. arr (X)×2,(Y)×1,(1–22)×3
                 SNP microarray analysis is consistent with triploidy, 69,XXY.

           iv. arr (X,1–22)×3
                 SNP microarray analysis is consistent with triploidy, 69,XXX.

      v.   arr (X,18)×3
           Microarray analysis in a female is consistent with a single copy gain of chromosomes X and 18. Note: where more
           than one chromosome is involved, these are separated by a comma (,).

      vi. sseq (X,18)×3
           Shallow genome sequencing in a female is consistent with a single copy gain of chromosomes X and 18.

      vii. arr (8,21)×3
           Microarray analysis is consistent with a single copy gain of chromosomes 8 and 21.

      viii. arr (16q)×3
           Microarray analysis shows a single copy gain of the entire long arm of chromosome 16.

      ix. arr (18)×3
          or
          arr[GRCh38] 18p11.32q23(102,328_79,093,443)×3
           Microarray analysis shows a single copy gain of the entire chromosome 18, consistent with trisomy 18.

      x.   arr (21)×3
           or
           arr[GRCh38] 21q11.2q22.3(13,531,865_46,914,745)×3
           Microarray analysis shows a single copy gain of the entire long arm of chromosome 21. Note: most microarrays
           do not cover the repetitive short arm sequences of the acrocentric chromosomes and the short arm is therefore not
           reported in the nomenclature. Chromosome analysis is needed to determine whether this is a translocation type tri-
           somy or nondisjunction trisomy of chromosome 21.

      xi. arr (X,1–19,21,22)×3
           SNP microarray analysis is consistent with a near-triploidy in a female with two copies of chromosome 20.

      xii. arr[GRCh38] 15q11.1q13.2(20,366,669_30,226,235)×4
           Microarray analysis shows a two copy gain of proximal long arm of chromosome 15, resulting in tetrasomy of
           15q11.1 to 15q13.2. Distinguishing a supernumerary marker chromosome or an interchromosomal insertion from
           a triplication of this region requires conventional karyotyping or metaphase FISH.

      xiii. arr[GRCh38] Xq28(155,708,407_156,005,042)×1 or Yq12(56,894,927_57,191,562)×1
           Microarray analysis shows a single copy loss of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR2) that is found at either Xq28
           or Yq12. It cannot be determined if the loss is from the X chromosome or the Y chromosome in a male. FISH or
           chromosome analysis is required to confirm the location of loss.

      xiv. arr[GRCh38] Xp22.33 or Yp11.31p11.2(559,968_917,321)×3
           Microarray analysis of a male with a single copy gain within the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) of either Xp or
           Yp. Note: in GRCh38 the nucleotide positions are identical for this region on both X and Y chromosomes.

      xv. arr[GRCh38] (X)×2,Yp11.32p11.2(11,091_3,295,603)×1
           Microarray analysis shows the presence of a single copy of a segment of the short arm of the Y chromosome, with
           no detectable loss from the two X chromosomes nor autosomes. FISH or chromosome analysis is required to con-
           firm the structural nature of the gain that includes SRY. Note: the normal sex chromosomes are given in the nomen-
           clature for sex determination.

      xvi. arr[GRCh38] Yq11.23(24,741,599_24,873,358)×0,20q13.2q13.33(53,224,067_63,743,732)×3
           Microarray analysis shows a male profile with an interstitial loss within Y chromosome at band Yq11.23 and a gain
           of the distal long arm of chromosome 20 involving bands 20q13.2 to 20q13.33.

      xvii. arr[GRCh38] 1p36.33p36.32(827,048_3,736,354)×3,1q41q44(221,649,655_247,175,095)×1
           Microarray analysis shows an apparently terminal gain of part of the short arm of chromosome 1 and an appar-
           ently terminal loss of part of the long arm of chromosome 1. This result may indicate a duplication/deletion recom-
           binant chromosome derived from a parental inversion. Further testing is needed to establish the structural nature of
           the rearrangement. Note: microarray shows gain and loss of the most distal microarray markers of 1p36.33 and
           1q44 respectively, and are presumed to be terminal.

                 50,776,669)×3
                 Microarray analysis shows an apparently terminal single copy loss of part of the long arm of chromosome 20 and
                 an apparently terminal single copy gain of part of the long arm of chromosome 22 as covered by the microarray.
                 This finding may represent the inheritance of an unbalanced derivative chromosome from a parental translocation
                 and chromosome analysis of both parents is indicated.

                 Microarray analysis shows an interstitial loss within the long arm of chromosome 4 from bands 4q32.2 to 4q35.1.
                 The extended system shows the flanking nucleotides that do not show a copy number loss. This defines the maxi-
                 mum and minimum deleted region. Commas are not used in the nucleotides in the extended system. Note: in the

                 Microarray analysis shows a single copy gain involving the short arm of chromosome 11 within band 11p12. The
                 gain is approximately 1.47 Mb in size. The extended system shows the next neighboring proximal and distal nucle-
                 otides with normal copy number. This defines the maximum and minimum region of the duplication. Commas are

                 Microarray analysis shows three abnormalities: a single copy loss within the short arm of chromosome 9, an inter-
                 stitial loss of a segment of the long arm of chromosome 18 and gain of part of the long arm of chromosome 21.

                 Microarray analysis shows two separate interstitial deletions involving chromosome 14 in bands 14q31.1 and
                 14q32.33. Note: the abnormalities are shown from pter to qter, regardless of whether they are gains or losses.

                 Microarray analysis shows an apparently terminal single copy loss of the short arm of chromosome 18 and an ap-
                 parently terminal single copy loss of the long arm of chromosome 18. This most likely indicates a ring chromosome
                 18, although FISH or chromosome analysis is indicated for confirmation.



8.2.3      Inheritance

           When known, the parental origin of the abnormality may follow the copy number (×1, ×3, etc.).
           There is no space between the copy number and the inheritance abbreviation (dn, mat, pat, inh,
           dmat, dpat, dinh, umat, upat).

           rental studies, to be of maternal origin. The single copy loss of 9p22.3 to 9p22.2 and a single copy loss of 18q21.33
           to 18q22.1 are both apparently de novo. Note: the inheritance of each is listed after the specific gain or loss and the

           Microarray analysis shows a gain of two copies of part of the long arm of chromosome 22 within band 22q11.21.
           One gain is inherited from the mother and the other is inherited from the father, i.e., the individual has inherited the
           abnormality from each parent.

           The parental origin of the duplications cannot be specified where both parents are duplication carriers, as there are
           multiple recombinant and segregation possibilities that could account for the six copies.

           determined to be derived from a known maternal translocation. Microarray testing of both parents is required to
           determine the origin of the gain on chromosome 22.

                 of the distal short arm of chromosome 8 involving the segment 8p23.3 to 8p23.1 and a gain of the segment 8p23.1
                 to 8p21.2.

                 in the long arm of chromosome 2 that aligns with the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 2. Note: the micro-
                 array refines the breakpoint on chromosome 2, but as this is not evident in hindsight in the conventional karyotype

           Microarray analysis is interpreted in the context of metaphase FISH. An unbalanced translocation derived from a
           rearrangement between the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes is detected. This has resulted in loss of distal
           Xp and gain of the short arm of the Y chromosome involving PAR1 including SRY.

           Microarray analysis shows a single copy gain of the short arm of chromosome 1, spanning approximately 4.6 Mb
           and likely identifying the marker chromosome. Most microarray platforms will not detect the pericentromeric alpha-
           satellite DNA and the centromeric bands are rarely included in the nomenclature of rings and markers. FISH is
           required to confirm the involvement of the centromere. An amended result after FISH analysis could be written as:

           mosome 1 and a single copy gain of part of the long arm of chromosome 15. This could represent a marker com-
           prised of material from chromosomes 1 and 15, and FISH is needed for confirmation.

                 sion. Thus, this example is a duplication/deletion recombinant chromosome derived from an inversion in the father.

           SNP microarray analysis of a neoplastic sample shows three copies of chromosomes 5 and 6 in 30% of the sample.
           There is a cell line with gain of a region within 7q34, but the copy number is uncertain. There is allelic imbalance
           demonstrated in the B allele frequency (BAF) plot for this region, but it is not possible to determine the copy num-
           ber precisely. Note: a question mark within square brackets ([?]) is used to indicate that the proportion of the
           sample tested that has the gain, is unknown. Where clinically relevant, copy number should be confirmed by an-
           other method.

           Microarray analysis of a neoplastic sample shows amplification of a region in 7p11.2. The exact copy number is
           too large to be enumerated accurately by microarray. Note: a question mark within square brackets ([?]) is used

           Microarray analysis of a neoplastic sample shows amplification of 2p24.3 including the MYCN gene, the proportion
           of cells with the amplification is unknown. One additional copy of chromosome 8 and two additional copies of
           chromosome 21 are present in 80% of the sample. Note: alternative methods are required to determine if there is
           evidence of clonal evolution. This is a limitation of microarray technology.

                 this result likely indicates mosaicism for an additional isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12 such as
                 those found in Pallister-Killian syndrome, FISH or chromosome analysis is needed for confirmation. The tilde (~)

8.2.6      Nomenclature Specific to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Microarray

           SNP microarray platforms can detect regions of homozygosity that may represent ancestral homo-
           zygosity, parental consanguinity, uniparental disomy, and in neoplastic disease, regions of acquired
           loss of heterozygosity.
        a. The zygosity of chromosomal regions may be defined as heterozygous (htz) or homozygous (hmz).
        b. SNP microarrays can be used to detect abnormalities relative to genome ploidy and given using the
           symbols, <n>, <2n>, <3n>, etc.
        c. Uniparental disomy where the parental origin has been determined can be designated by umat or
           upat.
           i.    arr (X,1–22)×2hmz
                 Complete hydatidiform mole that represents a monospermic fertilization of an empty ovum. There is no maternal
                 complement.

           ii.   arr (X,1–22)×2hmz htz
                 Complete hydatidiform mole represents a dispermic fertilization of an empty ovum with both sperm carrying an X
                 chromosome. There is no maternal complement. Note: in this abbreviated system (microarray format) of nomen-
                 clature, hmz htz indicates that there are alternating stretches of homozygosity and heterozygosity across the stated
                 chromosomes. The hmz is given before htz following the alphabetical order rule.

           iii. arr (X,Y)×1,(1–22)×2hmz htz

           SNP microarray analysis shows a pattern consistent with an XY/XX chimera. A male complement in 70% and a
           female complement in 30% of the sample is observed. An additional copy of chromosome 18 is also detected in
           70% of the sample, presumably in the male complement, although confirmation of this finding is required. Note:
           the normal female cell line and sex chromosome complement are indicated for clarity. A prenatal karyotype con-

  xviii. arr (X,3,7,9q,13–17,19,20,22)×1[1.0]
       SNP microarray analysis indicates a near-haploid profile in a neoplastic sample from a female. Chromosomes 1, 2,
       4 to 6, 8, 9p, 10 to 12, 18, and 21 show a heterozygous state, representing the normal copy number and
       therefore are not specified. Whereas chromosomes X, 3, 7, 13 to 17,19, 20, 22 and 9q show one copy compared to
       the heterozygous state. Based on only SNP microarray data, it is not always possible to determine whether this
       concerns a near-haploid complement or a mixture of near-haploid and doubled near-haploid complements. Note:
       the near-haploid complement represents 100% of the sample.

       SNP microarray results from a neoplastic sample indicate that all chromosomes are abnormal compared to normal
       diploidy, either by abnormal copy number or loss of heterozygosity. The clonal population is 100% of the sample.
       This finding may represent doubling of the near-haploid clone in the example above.

       SNP microarray analysis of a neoplastic sample shows the region of chromosome 12 between 12q11 and 12q13.13
       displays mosaic copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH), and there is gradual increase in separation of the
       B allele frequency heterozygous plot indicating that there are numerous subclones with slightly differing break-
       points. The tilde (~) between the chromosomal breakpoints indicates a range to demonstrate these multiple subclone
       breakpoints. The proporton of the clones, as calculated from the BAF, ranges from approximately 20–30% of the

                    SNP microarray in a neoplastic sample shows heterozygous loss within the short arm of chromosome 1 within band
                    1p33 and biallelic loss within band 7p14.1. There are segments of copy neutral loss of heterozygosity in bands
                    9p24.3 to 9p21.3 and 9p21.3 to 9p21.1 and a biallelic deletion within band 9p21.3 that includes CDKN2A. In addi-
                    tion, there is CN-LOH of chromosome 10 between 10q22.1 to 10q26.3. STIL::TAL1 fusion in 1p33 and the TRG
                    rearrangement in 7p14.1 can be confirmed using alternative methods.

8.2.7         Complex Array Results

        a. The abbreviation cx for complex chromosome rearrangement is used where there are numerous re-
           arrangements across the entire genome or within a region of a chromosome, or numerous copy num-
           ber gains and/or losses and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH)/absence of heterozygosity (AOH),
           within a chromosome region.
        b. The complex (cx) abbreviation is used where the definition of chromothripsis or chromoanasynthe-
           sis is not met.
              i.    arr (X,1–22)cx
                    Microarray analysis shows multiple complex rearrangements across the entire genome in a female.

         arm of chromosome 8 at 80%, deletion of 11q22.3 to 11q24.2 at 50%, 13q14.1 to 13q21.31 at 30% and 17p13.3 to
         17p11.21 at 80%. Note: it is a limitation of microarray that it cannot determine whether the abnormalities are in the
         same or different clones.
c. In complex array results, as may be the case in neoplastic samples, the laboratory may choose to
   display results in table form instead of in an ISCN description. The information in the table must
   include the chromosomes and bands corresponding to the variant, the type of variant (loss, gain,
   amplification or region of homozygosity), the designated genome build and the genomic coordinates
   of the variant. An example table is given below (Table 9). The inclusion of a table does not replace
   the written description/interpretive comment.

8.2.7.1           Chromoanagenesis


                  Complex genome rearrangements grouped under chromoanagenesis, i.e., chromoanasynthesis
                  (cha), chromoplexy (cpx), and chromothripsis (cth), may be challenging to differentiate as mul-
                  tiple overlapping genome instability and repair mechanisms may be present in an individual sample.
                  Illustrations of these highly complex events are described in Figure 10. The mechanism for chro-
                  moplexy is shown in Figure 10 for comparison although it is not detected by microarray technology.

                  mothripsis, a chromosome in a micronucleus can undergo massive DNA damage and result in multiple double-strand
                  breaks (DSBs, depicted with dashed black lines). When the micronucleus is re-incorporated into the nucleus during mi-
                  tosis, the DSBs undergo repair through Non-Homologous End Joining (c-NHEJ), where chromosome segments are ran-
                  domly stitched back together, lost, or become double minutes. Functionally relevant segments could become double
                  minutes and undergo amplification, as has been observed in MYC and other oncogene-containing segments in various
                  cancer cases (Stephens et al., 2011; Rausch et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2016). b In chromoplexy, different DSBs can be
                  repaired with or without DNA loss at the breakpoints and be arranged into various derivative configurations, as shown
                  here by the rearrangements of example derivative chromosomes A, B, and C. Chromoplexy is illustrated here for side-
                  by-side comparisons with chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis, and nomenclature for chromoplexy is illustrated in
                  Chapter 9. c In chromoanasynthesis, a normal chromosome can undergo DNA segment re-synthesis (dashed lines to
                  show template switches and solid arrows to show replication) mediated by replication processes such as fork-stalling and
                  template switching (FoSTeS) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR). These mechanisms
                  lead to templated insertions that exhibit higher copy-number and may be arranged in different orientations (depicted in
                  light grey and darker grey with black arrows signifying inverted sequence orientation). Notice the chromoanasynthesis
                  chromosome has a copy-number profile exhibiting intercalating duplication-normal-duplication copy-number states, as
                  seen in previous studies (Liu et al., 2011). Note: this figure and legend were adapted from Zepeda-Mendoza and Morton
                  (2019).

8.2.7.1.1      Chromothripsis


               Chromothripsis (cth) is a single catastrophic event by which multiple rearrangements originate
               through random shattering and reshuffling of clustered chromosome regions and reassembly is pri-
               marily by classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ). This is observed by the formation of
               derivative chromosomes with multiple and complex rearrangements and in microarray, regions of
               alternating copy number states between one and two copies (Zepeda-Mendoza and Morton, 2019;
               Lin et al., 2023; Xue and Durocher, 2023).

                     some 21 (iAMP21). There are fluctuations of copy number gain between bands 21q11.2 to 21q22.11, amplification
                     between bands 21q22.11 to 21q22.3 including RUNX1 and an apparently terminal single copy loss involving
                     21q22.3. Note: the copy number profile of iAMP21 is consistent with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle followed
                     by chromothripsis. Due to the complexity of copy number change the size of the clonal population of subclones
                     cannot be determined.



8.2.7.1.2      Chromoanasynthesis


               Chromoanasynthesis (cha) is a phenomenon whereby multiple combinations of structural variants

8.3           Polar Bodies

              First and second polar bodies as well as the secondary and the fertilized oocyte are the result of mei-
              otic division (reduction division) and normally do not contain chromosomes, but one or two chro-
              matids (the same is true for secondary and tertiary spermatozoa). This section describes nomencla-
              ture for chromatid loss and gain in polar bodies or respective oocytes identified by the cytogenom-
              ic techniques of microarray (arr) and shallow genome sequencing (sseq).
        a.    If shallow genome sequencing is used, replace arr with sseq for normal and abnormal results.
        b.    As the resolution of shallow genome sequencing is approximately 5-10 Mb, the normal result can
              be described, acknowledging limitations of the technique.
        c.    Following meiosis 1, the first polar body (PB1) consists of two chromatids, usually from a single
              chromosome for chromosomes X and 1–22.
        d.    At fertilization, meiosis 2 is completed forming the second polar body (PB2) which consists of
              only one chromatid for X and 1–22.
        e.    When describing normal or abnormal PB results, the term chromatid (cht) is used.
        f.    PB1 nomenclature is given in relation to a normal haploid set of two chromatids for X,1–22.
        g.    PB2 nomenclature is given in relation to the number of chromatids where the normal haploid set is
              one chromatid for X,1–22.
        h.    These terms however, are also appropriate to describe the respective oocytes. It should also be not-
              ed that although both polar bodies are analyzed, the deduced result of the oocyte is needed to make
              a diagnosis (i.e., whether or not the oocyte is chromosomally normal so it can be fertilized for further
              development into an embryo).
        i.    Polar bodies 1 and 2 have different numbers of chromatids, and the microarray/sseq profiles regard-
              ing copy number are interpreted accordingly.

9.1         Introduction

            In addition to detection of both balanced and unbalanced structural variation, genome mapping can
            detect copy number changes analogous to chromosomal microarray analysis (Levy et al., 2022;
            Smith et al., 2022; Iqbal et al., 2023; Sahajpal et al., 2023). The nomenclature for genome mapping
            (Moore et al., 2023) uses elements of karyotype, microarray and region-specific nomenclature to
            describe the observed structural and copy number variation.
                The ISCN description of genome mapping results does not indicate the platform used (i.e., opti-
            cal or electronic genome mapping), the labelling strategy (e.g., DLE-1), the type of genome assem-
            bly (e.g., rare variant, de novo, or guided), the version of bioinformatic pipeline, and whether any
            custom filter settings are in use, therefore these must form part of the descriptive narrative in the
            report. If classification is performed via a filtered list of genes, the genes may be indicated in the
            interpretative section of the report or by a statement indicating that the list is available upon request.


9.2         General Principles

      a. The nucleotides listed are not necessarily those of the actual breakpoint, but rather indicate the ex-
         tent of the fragment as determined by the position(s) of the labelled DNA motif within the variant
         region and closest to the chromosomal breakpoint(s). For this reason, the enzyme labelling strategy
         must be stated in the techniques section of the report.
      b. The principles of genome mapping nomenclature are the same for constitutional and neoplastic
         samples.
      c. Only results that are abnormal, based upon the laboratory’s reporting procedures, are included in
         the ISCN description. The exception is that normal sex chromosomes may be reported for the pur-
         pose of sex determination.
      d. Assessment of copy number in genome mapping can be difficult because the technology does not
         sample single cells but rather assesses DNA from many cells. Note: gains and losses are reported
         relative to the normalised ploidy. It may not be possible to distinguish between a one copy gain in
         a high proportion of the sample and a two copy gain in a low proportion of the sample.
         Even when enrichment strategies have been performed in neoplastic samples the proportion of the
         sample with an abnormality given in the ISCN description may not be representative of the true
         level of the abnormality in the neoplasm, e.g., an abnormality in 80% of tumor cells would be in
         only 40% of the clinical sample if the tumor load is 50%. This is a limitation of the test.
      e. The proportion of abnormality within the sample cannot be used to determine subclone composition
         using this technology.
      f. The gene fusion definition has been harmonized between ISCN, the Human Genome Organisation
         (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee, Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC)
         Gene Fusion Specification, and Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Gene fusions occur
         when two or more genes join and result in a chimeric transcript and/or a novel interaction between
         a rearranged regulatory element with the expressed product of a partner gene (a regulatory fusion)
         (see Section 4.4.6.1).


9.3         Nomenclature Rules

      a. For general cytogenomic rules that are also applicable to genome mapping see Chapter 4.
      b. For nomenclature to describe targeted genome mapping see Section 10.6.
      c. There is a space after the technique, ogm or ogm[GRCh38], and before the rest of the ISCN de-
         scription of the result (see Section 4.4.1).


      142                   Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224        ISCN 2024
                            DOI: 10.1159/000538512
d. Results are reported in a single line of nomenclature. However, complex results can be presented in
   a table for clarity (see Tables 10 and 11).
e. Regardless of whether there is a structural abnormality or a copy number gain or loss, the aberra-
   tions are listed in numerical order from lowest to highest numbered chromosome. The sex chromo-
   some abnormalities are listed first with the X before the Y unless only the X chromosome is abnor-
   mal, then the normal Y is listed first (see Section 4.3).
f. The band designations and aberrant nucleotides are listed from pter to qter (as determined by the
   orientation of the region containing the centromere), consistent with the public databases of current
   genome builds on UCSC or Ensembl genome browsers (www.genome.ucsc.edu or www.ensembl.
   org).
g. Genome mapping nomenclature uses the karyotype format and the microarray format. The karyo-
   type format ISCN is used when the structural nature of the abnormality is apparent. It is possible to
   use both formats within the ISCN description although, for each chromosome, the nomenclature
   must consistently use either one format or the other. Within the nomenclature formats different sys-
   tems are used (see Section 4.7):
   • The abbreviated system (microarray format) is used for aneuploidy and chromoanagenesis
        where only the chromosome is given and no nucleotides. Copy number is given for aneuploidy
        but not for chromoanagenesis.
   • The short system (karyotype format) defines the structural abnormality by the chromosome
        breakpoints and nucleotides. Copy number is not included.
   • The short system (microarray format) defines abnormalities by the chromosome breakpoints and
        nucleotides. Copy number is included.
   • The detailed system (karyotype format) describes abnormal chromosomes in their entirety from
        pter to qter. In this system, when describing a derivative (der) chromosome, it is not necessary
        to use the terms del, dup, ins, inv or t because the structure is apparent from the nucleotide co-
        ordinate sequence. Copy number is not included.
   • The extended system (microarray format) includes the span of the nucleotides involved in the
        abnormality as well as the flanking uninvolved nucleotides. Commas are not used in the nucle-
        otides. Copy number is included.
h. Commas (,) in nucleotide numbers are optional but improve readability. It is recommended not to
   include commas in the extended form where the maximal and minimal extent of the copy number
   variant (CNV) is given (see Section 4.4.5).
i. An underscore (_) indicates that the gain, loss, or inversion encompasses the segment between the
   listed nucleotides. A tilde (~) between two nucleotide coordinates indicates uncertainty of the break-
   point.
j. A semicolon (;) separates nucleotides that are aberrant due to translocation in the short system
   (karyotype format) and a double colon (::) separates the nucleotides to indicate breakage and re-
   union in the detailed system (karyotype format). It is also used to indicate breakage and reunion of
   chromosomes where it is uncertain if the change is intrachromosomal or interchromosomal (see
   Section 9.4.2.5).
k. To indicate a mixed cell population, the proportion of cells in the sample with the copy number vari-
   ant (CNV) is estimated from the fractional copy number and is included in square brackets ([ ])
   following the copy number.
l. When mixed cell populations can be distinguished for constitutional and unrelated clones, the larg-
   est cell line/clone is listed first. For related clones in neoplasia, the least complex clone is listed first.
m. For structural changes, the variant allele frequency (VAF) may be included after the abnormality
   in square brackets ([ ]) and annotated VAF to distinguish it from the proportion of the sample cal-
   culated using the fractional copy number, e.g., [VAF0.2]. Alternatively, it may be included in the
   text description within the report or in the tabular form. Note: for neoplastic samples the VAF in
   the sample may not represent the level of abnormality in the tumor.

        n. Listing of gene(s) is not mandatory in the genome mapping nomenclature but when given, the
           gene(s) listed are not italicised. Only those participating in fusion gene formation (whether resulting
           in chimeric gene products or involving regulatory elements) or that are investigated by targeted as-
           says, are reported (see Sections 9.4.2.3 and 9.4.2.5). Genes involved in fusion gene formation are
           separated by a double colon (::), while all others are separated by a comma (,) (Bruford et al., 2021).
        o. In karyotype format nomenclature the gene(s) is indicated in parentheses (( )) immediately after
           the abnormality and before the square brackets ([ ]) indicating the proportion of the sample or VAF.
           Loss or gain of critical genes is indicated by a minus (−) or plus (+) sign after the gene symbol in
           the karyotype format (see Section 9.4.2.3) and the double colon (::) indicates gene fusion. In mi-
           croarray format nomenclature the gene(s) is indicated in parentheses (( )) immediately after the
           abnormality and before the copy number. The minus (−) and plus (+) signs are not used in the mi-
           croarray format. For intragenic deletion or duplication no gene symbol is used in the ISCN descrip-
           tion as the entire gene is not involved, but it may be appropriate to name the gene in the text of the
           report (see Section 9.4.2.3). Genes of no known clinical significance to the referral type and those
           not involved in structural change are not listed.
        p. If genome mapping further clarifies the karyotype and, in retrospect, the abnormality can be visual-
           ized with banding, the karyotype may be amended to reflect this new genome mapping information.
           If the abnormality is cryptic and cannot be visualized by banding, the abnormality is not listed in
           the banded karyotype. Conversely, if genome mapping does not confirm a change visible by karyo-
           type then the karyotypic abnormality may still be reported if a further review of the karyotype con-
           firms its presence (see Section 4.6).
        q. Genome mapping analysis can demonstrate a relative gain or loss of DNA although analysis by an-
           other technique may be necessary to report ploidy. Genome mapping does not always allow dis-
           crimination between homologous chromosomes.


9.4           Nomenclature Examples

              All examples below use genome build GRCh38. The genome build must be stated if nucleotide
              coordinates are present in the nomenclature, but is not required if only whole chromosome, or chro-
              mosome arm aneuploidy is reported without nucleotide coordinates.


9.4.1         Normal Results

              If no clinically significant abnormality is detected using genome mapping the sex chromosomes are
              given first and are separated from the autosomes. There is a space between ogm and the opening
              parenthesis.
              i.    ogm (X,1–22)×2
                    Genome mapping in a female with no abnormality detected.

              ii.   ogm (X,Y)×1,(1–22)×2
                    Genome mapping in a male with no abnormality detected.

              iii. ogm (1–22)×2
                    Genome mapping with no abnormality detected and the sex is not disclosed.

              iv. 46,U.ogm (1–22)×2
                    Karyotype and genome mapping show no abnormality and the sex chromosomes are undisclosed.

9.4.2        Abnormal Results

             Some of the examples in this chapter do not represent observed genome mapping data but are pro-
             vided to demonstrate nomenclature principles (i.e., the nucleotide coordinates may not be the same
             as would be obtained from experimental data).


9.4.2.1      Aneuploidy of Whole Chromosomes or Chromosome Arms

             i.    ogm (X)×1[0.6]
                   Genome mapping shows loss of the X chromosome in 60% of the sample in a female. Note: the abbreviated system
                   (microarray format) of nomenclature is used in the description of whole chromosome aneuploidy.

             ii.   ogm (X)×0[0.5],(Y)×1
                   Genome mapping shows loss of the X chromosome in 50% of the neoplastic sample in a male.

             iii. ogm (X,21)×3
                   Genome mapping shows three copies of chromosomes X and 21.

             iv. ogm (21,22)×3[0.2]
                   Genome mapping shows three copies of chromosomes 21 and 22 in approximately 20% of a neoplastic sample.

             v.    ogm (X)×1
                   Genome mapping shows the presence of a single X chromosome and is consistent with 45,X in a constitutional
                   sample.

             vi. ogm (X)×1,(Y)×0[0.8]
                   Genome mapping shows the presence of a single X chromosome and is consistent with acquired loss of the Y chro-
                   mosome in 80% of a neoplastic sample. Note: inclusion of the X chromosome is optional in neoplasia.

             vii. ogm (X)×2,(Y)×1
                   Genome mapping shows the presence of two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome, consistent with an XXY
                   chromosome complement in a constitutional sample.

             viii. ogm (X)×1,(Y)×2
                   Genome mapping shows gain of the Y chromosome in a male, consistent with an XYY sex chromosome comple-
                   ment.

             ix. ogm (X)×2[0.5],(Y)×1,(8,21)×3[0.5]
                   Genome mapping shows gain of chromosomes X, 8 and 21 in approximately 50% of this neoplastic sample in a
                   male. The normal Y chromosome is given so it is clear that this is a male with gain of an X chromosome.

             x.    ogm (17p)×1[0.7],(17q)×3[0.7]
                   Genome mapping shows loss of the entire short arm of chromosome 17 and gain of the entire long arm of chromo-
                   some 17 in approximately 70% of a neoplastic sample.



9.4.2.2      Deletion


             The abbreviation (del) is used to denote both terminal and interstitial deletions and is used when
             the chromosomal structure can be ascertained. Alternatively, the microarray format may be used by
             indicating the copy number (e.g., ×1). If using the karyotype format, deletions within a chromosome
             band are given with the band listed twice, whereas the band is listed only once in the microarray
             format (see Table 4 in Section 4.7). Schematic representation of an interstitial deletion identified by
             genome mapping is shown in Figure 11. A comment may be made in the text of the report to discuss
             the size variation between the actual deletion and the deletion reported in the ISCN description.

      seghyan). The reference map breakpoints 1 and 10 are listed in the ISCN however, these labels are aligned to sample map
      locations A and B, with a total distance between them of 4 kb, indicating that the actual deletion size is equal to 6 kb
      (difference between reference and sample maps). In general, it is not necessary to include this remnant DNA in the ge-
      nome mapping nomenclature, but a comment may be made in the text of the report to explain the discrepancy between
      the ISCN breakpoints and the actual size of the deletion when required. *Variable size refers to the deletion specific
      distance between points A and B.

            Genome mapping shows an interstitial deletion of 2.2 Mb within 17q11.2 in approximately 50% of the neoplastic
            sample. The loss includes the NF1 gene. Note: inclusion of the NF1 gene in the ISCN description is not manda-
            tory, but if included, it is placed in parentheses (( )) immediately before the square brackets ([ ]) containing the
            proportion of the abnormality in the sample, e.g.,

            Genome mapping shows an interstitial deletion between bands 11q14.1 and 11q22.3 involving nucleotides
            80,488,887 to 108,177,359. The actual size of the deletion is 27,684 kb, whereas the size obtained from the two
            adjacent fluorescent label positions is 27,688 kb as there is 4 kb of residual DNA between the fluorescent label po-
            sitions. See Figure 11 for a diagrammatic explanation.

           ogm[GRCh38] del(22)(q11.21q11.21)(18,858,640_21,290,760)
            Genome mapping shows a 2.4 Mb interstitial deletion within 22q11.21. The expanded system (microarray format)
            shows that the next neighboring proximal nucleotide that does not show a loss is 3 kb away and the next neighbor-
            ing distal nucleotide that does not indicate that a loss is 3.8 kb away from the alteration. Note: demarcating commas
            are not used in the nucleotide coordinates in the expanded system as the nucleotide coordinates and copy number
            designation become confused.

         Genome mapping shows an interstitial deletion of Xq25 involving loss of nucleotides between 126,228,413 and
         126,535,347 of maternal origin in a male. If the normal Y chromosome is not given in the ISCN, then the report

       ogm[GRCh38] del(6)(q21q25.1)(113,900,000_149,100,000)[0.5],(21)×3c
         Genome mapping of a neoplastic sample shows an interstitial loss in the long arm of chromosome 6 from 6q21 to
         6q25.1 in 50% of the sample. There is a single copy gain (trisomy) of chromosome 21 that is constitutional. Note:
         copy number loss due to structural abnormality may be presented in a microarray format nomenclature (×1) or
         karyotype format nomenclature (del). Whole chromosome aneuploidy is reported using the (abbreviated system)
         microarray format.

         Genome mapping shows two overlapping interstitial deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 13 in a CLL
         sample. There is a larger deletion of 13q14.2 to 13q14.3 involving loss of approximately 2.3 Mb from one chromo-
         some 13 in approximately 40% of the sample and a smaller deletion of approximately 500 kb within 13q14.3 of the
         other homologue in approximately 20% of the sample. For clarity single underlining (_) may be used to distinguish
         homologous chromosomes in the short system (karyotype format).

         Genome mapping shows the same interstitial deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 13 as seen in the
         previous example. The homologues could not be distinguished, and so the three segments are listed from pter to
         qter using the short system (microarray format). Note: in the microarray format description of the deletion within
         13q14.3, the band is not repeated (see Table 4).

       [0.3],(1q)×3[0.3],(5,7,9,19)×3[0.5]
         Genome mapping of a neoplastic sample from a male shows gain of Xq24 to Xq28 in 30% of the sample; an inter-
         stitial deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 1 in 30% of the sample; gain of the entire long arm of chro-
         mosome 1 in 30% of the sample, and trisomies of chromosomes 5, 7, 9 and 19 in 50% of the sample. Note: it is a
         limitation of genome mapping that it cannot determine whether the abnormalities are in the same or different clones.

                      and the result is confirmed by in situ hybridization using a probe for CDKN2A. There are two segments of hetero-
                      zygous loss that are present in 40% of the sample and one segment of homozygous loss in 60% of the sample. There
                      is insufficient structural information to determine the extent of deletion on each homologue, therefore the segments

9.4.2.3         Duplication

                The abbreviation (dup) is used for duplications. Alternatively, the microarray format may be used

                      orientation of the duplicated sequence is maintained. In this example the short system (microarray format) is shown
                      first followed by the alternative short system (karyotype format). The position of the duplication is indicated in
                      neither format, but it is assumed that it is a tandem duplication. Note: copy number changes may be presented either
                      using microarray format (×3) or karyotype format (dup).

                  Genome mapping shows duplication of the KMT2A gene within 11q23.3 in 60% of a neoplastic sample. Note: the
                  first option uses the short system (microarray format) and does not provide structural information. It shows that
                  there are three copies of KMT2A in 60% of the sample. The second option uses the short system (karyotype format)
                  and shows that there are two copies of KMT2A on one of the chromosome 11 homologues.




9.4.2.4      Insertion


             The orientation of the insertion (ins) is indicated by the order of the bands and the nucleotide co-
             ordinates of the inserted region when the detailed system (karyotype format) of nomenclature is
             used. Insertions, for which the identity of the inserted material is unknown, are described by use of
             the abbreviations ins and question mark (?) and making use of a tilde (~) to reflect uncertainty of
             the breakpoint localization at the point of the insertion. As demonstrated in Figure 12, a 6 kb seg-
             ment of unknown DNA is inserted between 1∼4 kb of the reference. If the size of the unknown in-
             sertion is not provided in the report text, it is not possible for the reader of the nomenclature to know
             the size of the inserted material.

                        by a double colon (::) even though the insertion is intrachromosomal. To describe the chromosome using the de-

9.4.2.5       Inversion and Translocation


          a. The same rules apply to genome mapping as are applied to karyotype descriptions of translocations
             however, the nucleotide coordinates at the chromosome breakpoints are indicated and the formation
             of fusion genes or the involvement of other significant genes may be indicated.
          b. In the case of gene fusions that alter regulation (e.g., IGH::MYC) the regulatory element (reported
             first in the ISCN description) and regulated element are given even if the break occurs outside the
             gene region.
          c. Fusion genes that form a chimeric transcript are reported with the 5′ gene first, followed by the 3′
             gene.
          d. It can be difficult to discriminate between homologous chromosomes in genome mapping, and in-
             versions may appear identical to translocations between homologues. Examples viii and ix demon-
             strate the specific nomenclature to deal with this issue.
          e. Genome mapping may call a reciprocal translocation with a region of uncertainty, or displacement of the
             breakpoint on the two hybrid maps. This region of uncertainty can be indicated by use of the tilde (~).

                    Genome mapping shows a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 6 and 7. The chromosomes and break-
                    points are separated by a semicolon (;) as are the nucleotides. Note: the use of a tilde (~) to demonstrate the region
                    of uncertainty of the breakpoints.

                    Genome mapping analysis of a neoplastic sample shows a translocation between 3q26.2 (between nucleotides

                    of the MECOM gene cluster and ETV6. The translocation is present at a VAF of 30%.

            Genome mapping shows a 65 kb interstitial deletion within band 7p12.2 in approximately 80% of the sample. This
            deletion includes part of the IKZF1 gene. The translocation t(9;22) that results in a BCR::ABL1 fusion gene is also
            present and its VAF should be indicated in the ISCN description, the text of the report or in a table (see Table 11).
            In the first ISCN description the chromosome 7 deletion is given using the short system (microarray format) and
            the translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 is given using the short system (karyotype format). In the alterna-
            tive description both abnormalities are given using short system (karyotype format). Note: genes with intragenic
            deletions are not included in the ISCN description (see Section 9.3).

            Genome mapping shows an interstitial deletion within 6q21 and a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes
            6 and 7. It is unclear whether the deletion is in the same chromosome 6 homologue that is involved in the translo-
            cation with chromosome 7.
            If the deletion is on the same chromosome 6 homologue near the translocation breakpoint, this would change the
            ISCN description to der(6) and the abnormalities would be listed pter to qter.
            If the deletion involves the other chromosome 6 homologue then the abnormalities are given in alphabetical order.
            Note: when it is uncertain whether abnormalities occur in cis or in trans, the nomenclature is written as if the ab-
            normalities are in trans.

            parent because the technology does not allow the homologous chromosomes 16 to be distinguished. Nomenclature

                      Karyotype analysis shows two different cell lines in a neoplastic sample: four metaphases with only one X chromo-
                      some and sixteen metaphases with one normal X chromosome and another X chromosome with additional mate-
                      rial of unknown origin replacing Xpter to Xp11.4. Microarray analysis shows an apparently terminal deletion of
                      the short arm of the X chromosome and gain of 11q12.3 to 11q25. Genome mapping shows that there is a derivative
                      X chromosome from a t(X;11) in 80% of the sample. The der(X)t(X;11) results in loss of Xpter to Xp11.4 and gain
                      of 11q12.3 to 11qter in 80% of the sample. The remaining 20% of the sample has only one intact X chromosome,
                      i.e., it is apparent that one copy of Xpter to Xp11.4 is present in 20% of the sample and one copy of Xp11.4 to Xqter
                      is present in 100% of the sample. The clones can be discerned in the genome mapping data because the karyotype
                      is known. Note: the data are presented in the order in which the analyses are performed. The karyotype result is
                      listed first but the microarray and genome mapping data may be listed in either order. The largest clone is listed
                      first (see Sections 4.5.3 and 9.3).

                      Genome mapping shows complex rearrangements involving chromosomes 3, 6 and 18. Most of the short arm of
                      the derivative chromosome 3 is replaced by rearranged sections of the chromosome 18 long arm (including a du-
                      plication within 18q22.1) and part of the chromosome 6 long arm. Part of the long arm of the derivative chromo-
                      some 6 is replaced by part of the long arm of chromosome 18 and part of the chromosome 3 short arm. The de-
                      rivative chromosome 18 distal to q12.2 is replaced by material from the short arm of chromosome 3 and the long
                      arm of chromosome 6. Note: for clarity in complex cytogenomic ISCN descriptions the karyotype format is used.
                      Terms such as dup and inv are not employed in the description of a derivative chromosome using the detailed
                      system (karyotype format) nomenclature. Structural changes such as dup and inv, are apparent from the nucleotide
                      coordinates of the translocated segments that are written as they are oriented pter to qter on the derivative chromo-
                      some. The pter to qter orientation is determined by the orientation of the segment containing the centromere. A
                      schematic diagram of the rearrangements is shown in Figure 13.



9.4.2.7.1        Chromoanagenesis


                 Complex genome rearrangements grouped under chromoanagenesis, i.e., chromoanasynthesis
                 (cha), chromothripsis (cth) and chromoplexy (cpx), may be challenging to differentiate as mul-
                 tiple overlapping genome instability and repair mechanisms may be present in an individual sample.
                 See Figure 10 for illustrations of these highly complex events that are described below by the sim-
                 plified nomenclature. Note: genome mapping may not always differentiate between chromothripsis
                 and chromoanasynthesis; in this case, the term complex (cx) may be used with clarification pro-
                 vided in the interpretation.


9.4.2.7.1.1      Chromothripsis


                 Chromothripsis (cth) is a phenomenon by which multiple rearrangements originate through ran-
                 dom shattering and reshuffling of clustered chromosome regions in a single catastrophic event (see
                 Section 8.2.7.2).

                      Genome mapping shows multiple alternating copy number changes in the short arm of chromosome 2 that are con-
                      sistent with chromothripsis.

9.4.2.7.1.2      Chromoanasynthesis


                 Chromoanasynthesis (cha) is a phenomenon by which multiple combinations of structural variants
                 resulting in copy number changes (commonly duplications) (see Section 8.2.7.3).

                       Genome mapping analysis shows multiple changes of copy number, consistent with chromoanasynthesis involving
                       chromosome 3.

                       Genome mapping analysis shows multiple changes of copy number involving most of the short arm of chromosome
                       17. Note: it is not possible to determine the size of the clone with chromothripsis of chromosome 17, so the propor-
                       tion of the sample bearing this abnormality is given as a question mark in square brackets ([?]).




9.4.2.7.1.3      Chromoplexy


                 Chromoplexy (cpx) is a phenomenon where derivative chromosomes are generated by the chimeric
                 joining of DNA segments from two or more chromosomes. Chromosome reassembly is predicted
                 to occur by c-NHEJ or alternative end joining (Alt-EJ) repair (Zepeda-Mendoza and Morton, 2019)
                 (see Fig. 10).

                       croarray format) of nomenclature.
                       See also Section 9.4.2.7 for an example of the detailed system (microarray format) of nomenclature that can also
                       be applied to describe chromoplexy.



9.4.2.8          Multiple Techniques


                 Where multiple techniques are used, the karyotype is reported first, if performed, and other tech-
                 niques may be reported in any order, e.g., they may be presented in the order in which they are per-
                 formed. The ISCN description for each subsequent technique is preceded by a period (.).

                       Karyotype analysis detected a de novo marker. Genome analysis shows a single copy de novo gain of the short arm
                       of chromosome 1 from bands 1p12 to 1p11.2, spanning approximately 3.4 Mb, likely identifying the marker chro-

                       are rarely included in the nomenclature of rings and markers after genome mapping analysis. The centromere is
                       probably included in the aberration and could be confirmed by in situ hybridization. An amended result after in situ
                       hybridization analysis would be written as given in example ii.

10.1       Introduction

           Region-specific assays (rsa) are used to quantify the number of copies or structural rearrangement(s)
           of a chromosome and/or chromosomal region. They are applicable only to diagnostic tests and en-
           compass several diagnostic technologies, i.e.,
           • Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)
           • Quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR)
           • Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
           • Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD). Note: rsa nomenclature must not be used for screen-
               ing technologies, e.g., screening by NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing)
           • Bead-based assays
           • Targeted microarrays that are limited to a number of regions that can be reasonably listed in the
               nomenclature
           • Masked or targeted genome mapping
           • Targeted chromosome analysis (sometimes referred to as scoring) for a chromosome abnormal-
               ity where a full karyotype is not performed.


10.2       RSA Nomenclature Specific Rules

       a. For general cytogenomic rules that are also applicable to this chapter see Chapter 4.
       b. Region-specific assays (rsa) is a generic nomenclature for targeted assays other than FISH and de-
          scribes the normal and/or abnormal results for the chromosomes/regions tested.
       c. It is essential that the written report includes details of the specific targeted RSA cytogenomic tech-
          nique undertaken as well as the resolution and limitations of the test.
       d. The rsa nomenclature can be written in the abbreviated, short, detailed or extended systems depend-
          ing on whether the results are given in a karyotype format or the microarray format (see Section
          4.7). The karyotype format uses the short and detailed systems while the microarray format uses the
          abbreviated, short and extended systems.
          • The abbreviated system (karyotype and microarray formats) describes the abnormality/abnor-
               malities with no breakpoints and no nucleotides, e.g., rsa (21)×3 or rsa (X,Y)×1,(13,18)×2,(21)×3
               (Section 10.3.2) or rsa (5,7)×2[20] (Section 10.3.1).
          • The short system includes the breakpoints (karyotype format) or nucleotides (microarray format)
               involved in the abnormality, e.g., rsa (21)×1,i(21)(q10)×1 (see Section 10.3.3) and rsa[GRCh38]
               22q11.21 (18,891,533_21,111,169)×2 (see Section 10.4.1). In some instances, the use of the
               short system, and not the abbreviated system, will be essential to give clarity for an unbalanced
               result.
          • The detailed system (karyotype format only) defines each abnormal chromosome in terms of its
               band composition from pter to qter.
          • The extended system (microarray format only) describes the abnormality in detail including the
               flanking normal nucleotides, without any commas, e.g., rsa[GRCh38] 22q11.21(18889117×
               2,18891533_21111169×1,21116218×2).
       e. With targeted tests, limited chromosomes/regions/loci are analyzed and the normal state for the
          other chromosomes/regions/loci tested can either be included in the ISCN or the report description.
          The decision whether to list the normal loci in the assay in the ISCN is at the discretion of the labo-
          ratory, although in some instances the inclusion of the normal results adds clarity to the result. If the
          normal results are not given in the ISCN, then the normal state of the other chromosomes/regions/
          loci tested within the assay MUST be stated in the report description.
       f. Where a manufacturers’ kit is used, the kit number and version must be given in either the ISCN
          (see Sections 10.3.1 and 10.4) or the report text as applicable.

         g. The name of the MLPA kit can be used in the ISCN description if the genomic coordinates are not
            known; however, greater precision is achieved by providing nucleotide numbers. The span of nucle-
            otides is separated by an underscore (see Section 4.4.5). Commas in nucleotide numbers are option-
            al.
         h. There is a space after rsa or rsa[GRCh38] (see Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.5).
         i. The genome build is given when nucleotides are reported (see Section 4.4.5).
         j. If the genome build is not given in the nomenclature, e.g., for chromosome aneuploidy, the refer-
            ence sequence or kit is given in the written description of the report.
         k. To indicate a mixed cell population
            • For targeted chromosome analysis, the absolute cell numbers for each cell line are given in
                square brackets ([ ]).
            • For cytogenomic techniques, the proportion of cells within the sample with the abnormality can
                be estimated and included in square brackets ([ ]) following the copy number. If the proportion
                of abnormal cells cannot be estimated, the copy number range may be given (see Section 4.5.3).
            • The abbreviation mos is NOT used in rsa nomenclature.
         l. Results are listed in ascending numerical chromosome order, with the sex chromosomes listed first
            (see Section 4.3).
         m. Chromosomes with the same copy number can be included in the same parentheses but the chromo-
            some order rule must be followed (see Section 4.3 for chromosome order rules).
         n. Loci and genes are listed in chromosomal order and, within a chromosome, from pter to qter (see
            Section 4.3).
         o. Some of the ISCN examples in this chapter do not represent observed data but are provided to dem-
            onstrate the nomenclature principles.


10.2.1         Targeted Chromosome Analysis

         a. The abbreviated system (karyotype format) describes only the targeted chromosome(s) complement.
         b. The number of chromosomes is indicated by a multiplication (×) sign followed by the number of
            copies present.
         c. The short system describes the structural abnormality including the breakpoints. The inclusion of the
            non-rearranged homologues is optional unless there is loss or gain when their inclusion is essential, i.e.,
            • For balanced structural chromosome complements where the homologues are apparently normal
                the abbreviated or short system can be used. However, if the non-rearranged homologue is lost,
                then the short system of the nomenclature is used with the number of normal homologues
                described as zero, e.g., rsa (21)×0,i(21)(q10)×1 and rsa (8)×1,t(8;21)(q22;q22)×1,(21)×0[20]
                when there is no normal chromosome 21.
            • Unbalanced chromosome complements are always described in the short system where the normal
                chromosomes are also listed in the ISCN, e.g., rsa (21)×1,i(21)(q10)×1 (see Section 10.3.3).
         d. When a targeted screen is undertaken in combination with a full karyotype, the inclusion of the rsa
            ISCN description is optional if it does not add any additional information, i.e., If the karyotype is
            46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[4]/46,XX[18], and it is optional to include rsa t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)×1[30]/
            (9,22)×2[10].
         e. Absolute cell numbers are given in square brackets ([ ]) in targeted chromosome analysis for neo-
            plastic samples and to indicate mixed cell populations in both constitutional and neoplastic samples.

                             DOI: 10.1159/000538512
10.2.2       Fusion Genes

         a. Evidence of a fusion or juxtaposition of genes is indicated by a double colon (::), e.g., BCR::ABL1.
         b. In gene fusions, only the chimeric genes or those that alter the regulation of the gene is given in the
            ISCN description, e.g., BCR::ABL1 or IGH::CCND1, respectively. The reciprocal gene fusion is
            only given if both products are known to be oncogenic/expressed.
         c. If two or more different gene fusions are present, they are listed in the chromosomal order of the
            clinically relevant fusion gene.
         d. When it is unknown which is the active oncogenic transcript, then the fusion is described according
            to the numerical order of the chromosomes, and from pter to qter.


10.2.3       Methylation Specific Analysis

         a. Methylation specific MLPA (MS-MLPA) can detect copy number variation as well as the methyla-
            tion pattern.
         b. Both the copy number and methylation status must be given in the ISCN.
         c. The technique abbreviation used is rsa-ms.
         d. A normal methylation pattern is represented by met.
         e. If the methylation pattern is abnormal, then lom is used to describe the absence of methylation and
            gom for gain of methylation.
         f. The methylation nomenclature follows HGVS nomenclature (Monk et al., 2018) unless this contra-
            dicts the generic ISCN rules (see notes below under 10.2.3).
         g. The copy number is indicated by a multiplication (×) sign followed by the number of copies pres-
            ent (×), e.g., ×1 or ×2.
         h. The pipe character (|) is used to indicate that there is a modification of the sequence not a sequence
            variant, i.e., indicates a change of methylation status, e.g.,
            rsa-ms 11p15.5p15.4(ME030)×2(KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR)|lom,(H19/IGF2:IG-DMR)met
         i. If the copy number and methylation specific region are within the same breakpoint, then the
            breakpoint is not repeated for the methylation part of the ISCN, e.g.,
            rsa-ms[GRCh38] 11p15.5(1,995,605_2,004,583)×3(KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR)met,(H19/IGF2:IG-
            DMR)|gom
         j. Different CpG positions within the imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) may be ex-
            amined and the level of mosaicism may be different for each CpG position. If all the CpG islands
            show loss of methylation, it is optional whether the level of mosaicism is reported. If the mosaicism
            is reported, then it is recommended that the methylation status is described as an average percentage
            of all CpGs analyzed, i.e., [0.25]. Note: in HGVS curled parentheses ({}), i.e., are used for the av-
            erage percentage, and square brackets ([ ]) are used for alleles.
         k. If only some of the individual CpG islands show loss of methylation, then these may be specified
            individually (see Monk et al., 2018) at the discretion of the laboratory.
         l. If multiple methylation alleles are examined, these are separated by a comma. Note: in HGVS a
            semicolon (;) is used for different alleles and a comma (,) is used to separate different transcripts
            of the same allele (see Monk et al., 2018).

                     A low-level t(9;22) neoplastic clone detected in 2 out of 50 metaphases on combined full karyotyping and scoring.
                     The targeted chromosome analysis (scoring) for only chromosomes 9 and 22 did not detect a t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) in
                     30 metaphases. The text of the report gives the limitations of each analysis.

                     in a male.



10.3.2         Aneuploidy

               For the abbreviated system (karyotype and microarray formats) of the rsa nomenclature, the abnor-
               mal aneuploid nomenclature is the same for MLPA, QF-PCR, targeted microarray, or targeted chro-
               mosome analysis.

               i.    rsa (21)×3
                     Targeted chromosome analysis using the karyotype format confirms a non-disjunction trisomy 21 (i.e., excludes a
                     Robertsonian translocation) following a positive trisomy 21 result on QF-PCR.
                     QF-PCR & MLPA analysis using the microarray format shows an abnormal copy number result for chromosome
                     21 indicating a gain for the chromosome (trisomy). The normal disomic state for the other chromosomes tested must
                     be given in the written description of the report. Note: for clarity, the apparently normal disomic states for the sex
                     chromosomes (male) and chromosomes 13 and 18, which were also tested, may be included in the abbreviated sys-
                     tem nomenclature, i.e., rsa (X,Y)×1,(13,18)×2,(21)×3 or rsa (X,13,18)×2,(21)×3.
                     Targeted microarray analysis using the microarray format confirms trisomy 21 following a positive trisomy
                     21 result on NIPT; no other chromosome profiles were analyzed. Note: the abnormal nucleotides may also be
                     included in the short system (microarray format) nomenclature, i.e., rsa[GRCh38] 21q11.2q22.3(13,531,865_



         162                      Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224                 ISCN 2024

         46,914,745)×3. If all chromosomes had been analyzed, the nomenclature would be arr (21)×3 (abbreviated
         system, micorarray format) or arr[GRCh38] 21q11.2q22.3(13,531,865_46,914,745)×3 (short system, micro-
         array format) (see Section 8.2.2).

   ii.   rsa (13)×3
         Targeted chromosome analysis using the karyotype format confirms a non-disjunction trisomy 13 (i.e., excludes a
         Robertsonian translocation) following a positive trisomy 13 result on QF-PCR.
         QF-PCR & MLPA analysis using the microarray format shows an abnormal copy number result for chromosome
         13 indicating a gain for the chromosome (trisomy). The normal disomic state for the other chromosomes tested must
         be given in the written description of the report. Note: for clarity, the apparently normal disomic states for the sex
         chromosomes (female) and chromosomes 18 and 21, which were also tested, may be included in the abbreviated
         system nomenclature, i.e., rsa (X)×2,(13)×3,(18,21)×2.
         Targeted microarray analysis using the microarray format confirms trisomy 13 following a positive trisomy 13
         result on NIPT; no other chromosome profiles were analyzed. Note: the abnormal nucleotides may also be includ-
         ed using the short system (microarray format) in the nomenclature, i.e., rsa[GRCh38] 13q12.11q34

11.1        Introduction

            Historically, ISCN has covered the description of numerical and structural chromosome changes
            detected using a variety of traditional and molecular cytogenetic techniques, while the Human Ge-
            nome Variation Society (https://hgvs-nomenclature.org/; den Dunnen et al., 2016) covered the de-
            scription of changes at the nucleotide level. Both ISCN and HGVS have developed methods to de-
            scribe variants detected by microarrays, PCR, MLPA, and other technologies used to detect copy
            number variation (CNV). Given the increased use of sequencing technologies to characterize chro-

                                               DOI: 10.1159/000538512
               mosomal abnormalities (Schluth-Bolard et al., 2013; Ordulu et al., 2014; Newman et al., 2015), the
               method of combining the ISCN description of chromosome rearrangements with HGVS nucleotide
               variant descriptions, developed jointly between the ISCN and HGVS, was initially introduced in
               ISCN 2016. Sequencing technologies, including Sanger sequencing, next generation short-read and
               long-read sequencing, or other sequence-based techniques can use this nomenclature to describe
               copy number and/or structural variants. These techniques are quite broad in scope and resolution;
               they can be targeted to one region (e.g., single gene or exon), many regions (e.g., amplicon or cap-
               ture-based gene panels), or genome wide. Depending on the bioinformatic algorithms used, a struc-
               tural variant detected from next generation sequence data may have a precise breakpoint and struc-
               tural location information, such as the insertional location and orientation of a duplication. On the
               other hand, copy number variants may be detected using read depth-based algorithms, which detect
               copy number as a relative value to control(s) with neither precise breakpoints nor additional struc-
               tural information, similar to how copy number is detected from microarray technologies. Regardless
               of approach, uncertainty may be present, with a known uncertainty range (e.g., between two hybrid-
               ization baits or within a repeated element such as a LINE) or as an approximate breakpoint without
               a defined range (e.g., detected using a read depth caller from low coverage genome sequencing).


11.2           General Principles

11.2.1         Sequence-Based Nomenclature Principles

         a. The nomenclature should be as precise as possible for the technologies and bioinformatic algorithms
            used.
         b. ISCN and HGVS nomenclature can be used together to describe a structural or copy number vari-
            ant. When both the ISCN and HGVS nomenclature are described, the ISCN line of the description
            appears first.
         c. When details of the chromosomal structure are derived from sequencing techniques, both the ISCN
            description of chromosome aberrations and the HGVS nucleotide variant descriptions should be
            included for clarity and completeness.
         d. When only relative copy number state is determined, and neither the precise breakpoints nor struc-
            tural information is known, either the ISCN microarray format or HGVS nomenclature can be used
            alone.
         e. When only breakpoint information is available without the information sufficient to describe the
            nature of the structural rearrangements, HGVS standards should be used alone (examples are not
            detailed in this publication, see den Dunnen et al. (2016) and https://hgvs-nomenclature.org/).


11.2.2         ISCN Principles

         a. The ISCN line of the description begins with seq to indicate that the aberration is characterized by
            sequence-based technology. It must include the genome build in square brackets ([ ]) after seq if
            the nomenclature includes nucleotide coordinates. If shallow sequencing is performed, sseq should
            be used in the ISCN description of the variation (see Section 8.1.1).
         b. For description of structural or copy number variation when both the ISCN and HGVS are used, the
            ISCN uses the karyotype format nomenclature (see Section 4.7 and Chapter 5). Where several ab-
            normalities are described in the ISCN, a mixture of the short and detailed systems within the karyo-
            type format nomenclature can be used, as different levels of information may be known for each of
            the described aberrations.



         172                  Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224      ISCN 2024
                              DOI: 10.1159/000538512
         c. For description of copy number variations where structural information and exact breakpoints are
            not detected (e.g., relative copy number detection from exome sequencing), the ISCN should use
            the microarray format nomenclature (see Section 4.7 and Chapter 8).
         d. When chromosome analysis is performed, this is presented first and a period (.) precedes the
            sequencing nomenclature (.seq). For other techniques the results may be presented in any order,
            although this is usually the order in which they are performed.
         e. Sex chromosomes are not given, with the exceptions of (a) if a variant involving a sex chromosome
            is reported or (b) if the sex chromosome complement is informative or required for interpretation of
            the result. Otherwise, the sex chromosome complement may be indicated in the written description
            without being explicitly stated in the nomenclature.

         a. The combined nomenclature uses the existing HGVS standards for the HGVS line (see below, den
            Dunnen et al., 2016 and https://hgvs-nomenclature.org/) along with additional recommendations
            outlined below for the description of an aberration.
         b. HGVS nomenclature was developed to describe variants. Chromosomes or chromosomal segments
            that do not contain variants are not described using HGVS nomenclature, unless to indicate sex
            chromosome complement.
         c. Each line details the reference sequence(s) used, the genomic coordinates, and the type of variation(s)
            involved. Variants affecting different chromosomes are described on a separate line.
         d. The segment containing the centromere is the reference for the derivative chromosome(s). The ori-
            entation of the derivative chromosome is the same as the reference chromosome segment that in-
            cludes the centromere. A derivative chromosome is described from pter to qter, regardless of the
            origin of the sequences. This would mean that the new pter of a derivative chromosome could be
            the original qter of another chromosome.
         e. Multiple variants within the same homologue are described from pter to qter of the derivative chro-
            mosome, anchored in the positive strand.
         f. As in ISCN, aberrations affecting sex chromosomes are listed first (X then Y) followed by those
            affecting autosomes in ascending numbers.
         g. A specific reference for each chromosome is given, rather than the general genome build reference
            (e.g., NC_000023.11 for the NCBI RefSeq version for Homo sapiens X chromosome, build
            GRCh38). The chromosome is given before the period (.), with the X chromosome as 23 and the
            Y chromosome as 24. The number following the period (.) indicates the specific version of the
            chromosome reference sequence.
         h. A letter prefix indicates the type of reference sequence used. For linear genomic reference sequence
            g is used, followed by a period (.).
         i. The genomic reference sequence contains undefined nucleotides (Ns) at the start and end of the
            chromosome making the use of specific nucleotide positions for these sites problematic. The begin-
            ning and end of a chromosome are therefore represented as pter and qter.
         j. When the chromosome structure associated with a gain is not known (e.g., insertional location),
            gains can be indicated using the copy number in square brackets ([ ]) at the end of the nomencla-
            ture description, with [2] indicating one additional copy observed of a particular chromosome or
            chromosome region compared to the reference, [3] indicating two additional copies, etc.
         k. To describe variants (var), HGVS uses the following allele format:
            • g.[var1];[var2] in the two different alleles (in trans).
            • g.[var1;var2] to describe different variants in one allele (in cis).
            • g.var1(;)var2 if the phase of the alleles is not known or uncertain.

           l. If mosaicism/clonal change is present, the variant(s) are separated by a single slant line (/). The
              normal reference sequence, if present, is always described first and is followed by an equal symbol
              (=).
           m. To indicate sex chromosome complement, the HGVS allele format can be used; adding
              NC_000023.11:g.[pter_qter=] indicates the presence of a normal X chromosome, and
              NC_000024.10:g.[pter_qter=] the presence of a normal Y chromosome.
           n. For variants within the pseudoautosomal regions where there is uncertainty whether the X or Y
              chromosome is involved, a caret (^) should be used between the two possible variants.


11.2.3.1         Breakpoint Description


           a. An underscore (_) indicates a range of nucleotides, e.g., g.123_456del indicates a deletion of nu-
              cleotides 123 to 456.
              • When the breakpoints have not been determined at the precise nucleotide level, variants are de-
                   scribed with the ranges of uncertainty given in parentheses (()), using the format g.(A_B)_
                   (C_D). In this format A_D represents the maximal and B_C the minimal extent of the rearrange-
                   ment.
              • Unknown nucleotide positions are indicated using a question mark (?), e.g., g.(?_B)_(C_?)del
                   when the minimal range of a deletion is known, but not the maximal range.
              • For terminal (ter) copy number changes involving an unknown position in the direction of the
                   telomere, the format (pter)_B or C_(qter) is used.
           b. To determine the location of the breakpoint, the general HGVS rule of maintaining the longest un-
              changed sequence applies (HGVS 3′ rule) (see Section 11.2.3.2).
              • In runs of identical nucleotides, the most 3′ nucleotide in the run is designated as variant, e.g.,
                   g.4del (not g.2del nor g.3del) describes the change CTTTA to CTTA (see also Section 11.2.3.2).
           c. A double colon (::) is used to designate breakpoint junctions in HGVS, e.g., a ring chromosome. It
              is also used in the detailed system (karyotype format) (see Sections 5.4.2.2, 9.3 and 10.2.2).


11.2.3.2         Structural Variant Description


                 The type of structural variation is indicated following the nucleotide breakpoint positions except for
                 insertions where it precedes the nucleotides:
           a.    del – indicates a deletion. If the deletion is homozygous (e.g., found on both chromosomes), both
                 chromosomes should be described using the HGVS allele format (e.g., g.[123_456del];[123_456del]).
           b.    dup – exclusively indicates a tandem, direct duplication. If the duplicated sequence is not direct-
                 ly in tandem, e.g., separated by one or more nucleotides, inverted, and/or inserted elsewhere in the
                 genome, ins (for insertion) is used instead.
           c.    inv – indicates an inverted sequence (e.g., g.123_456inv).
           d.    ins – indicates an insertion of a sequence (e.g., insAAGTAC) that is not a tandem duplication. When
                 the inserted sequence is long, the sequence can be replaced by referring to a reference sequence and
                 specifying the inserted nucleotides (e.g., ins[NG_012232.1:g.4566_8781]). This insertion can be
                 balanced or involve duplicated material from elsewhere in the genome. A balanced insertion (trans-
                 position) would have a corresponding del nomenclature, indicating the genomic sequences are no
                 longer present in situ.
           e.    delins – indicates deletion and insertion, i.e., a sequence change where nucleotides are replaced by
                 other nucleotides (e.g., balanced or unbalanced translocations where genomic material is being re-
                 placed by sequence from a different chromosomal location).

                                 DOI: 10.1159/000538512
         f. sup – indicates a supernumerary sequence, i.e., the presence of an additional sequence that is not
            attached to other chromosomal material (i.e., trisomy, supernumerary marker or ring chromosome).
         g. Application of the 3′ rule to chromosome rearrangements:




                A translocation joins chromosome 2 and chromosome 18 (seq[GRCh38] nomenclature line above
            in bold). According to the chromosome 2 and chromosome 18 reference sequences, there are two options
            to align the breakpoints (dashed and solid vertical lines). The 3′ rule determines that, starting with the
            lowest chromosome number involved (here chromosome 2), the sequence should be aligned as far 3′ as
            possible, aligning with the solid vertical line. The correct description of the rearrangement is therefore:
                seq[GRCh38] t(2;18)(p25.3;p11.32)
                NC_000002.12:g.pter_8delins[NC_000018.10:g.pter_8]
                NC_000018.10:g.pter_8delins[NC_000002.12:g.pter_8]

                  Note: a 5′ alignment would give an incorrect result: NC_000002.12:g.pter_5delins
                  [NC_000018.10:g.pter_5] and NC_000018.10:g.pter_5delins[NC_000002.12:g.pter_5]


11.3        Normal Results
            i.    seq (X,1–22)×2
                  Sequencing reveals two copies of the X chromosome and all autosomes with no apparent abnormality detected in
                  a female. As with the microarray nomenclature, the specific genome build is not necessary when describing a nor-
                  mal copy number profile. HGVS nomenclature describes variants in relation to the reference sequence and is not
                  used in this context.

            ii.   seq (X,Y)×1,(1–22)×2
                  Sequencing reveals one copy of the X and Y chromosomes, and two copies of the autosomes with no apparent ab-
                  normality detected in a male. HGVS nomenclature describes variants in relation to the reference sequence and is
                  not used in this context.

            iii. seq (1–22)×2
                  Sequencing reveals two copies of all autosomes with no apparent abnormality detected, and the sex chromosome
                  complement is normal but undisclosed. HGVS nomenclature describes variants in relation to the reference sequence
                  and is not used in this context.

                  Sequencing reveals a single X chromosome, and no other sex chromosomes are present in this individual. The result
                  is given using the abbreviated system (microarray format) nomenclature, the specific genome build is not necessary
                  when describing an aneuploidy. The HGVS nomenclature describes the deletion of an X or Y chromosome, as the
                  missing chromosome is unknown (in HGVS ‘or’ is represented by a caret (^)).

            or
            NC_000013.11:g.(pter)_(qter)[2]
            Sequencing shows a gain of chromosome 13 sequences. The result is given using the abbreviated system (microar-
            ray format) nomenclature. No structural information is detected regarding whether the trisomy is associated with a
            Robertsonian translocation or any other type of structural rearrangement. The HGVS nomenclature indicates that,
            compared to the reference sequence, there is one additional copy [2] of chromosome 13 sequences detected. Note:
            dup or sup are not used in the nomenclature because the nature of the abnormality is not known. Since ISCN and
            HGVS nomenclature indicate similar information, either can be used.

      iii. 47,XY,+13.seq (13)×3
           or
           NC_000013.11:g.(pter)_(qter)sup
            Chromosome analysis and sequencing shows gain of chromosome 13. The HGVS nomenclature indicates there is
            one additional copy of chromosome 13 (sup) compared to the reference sequence. ISCN description and HGVS
            nomenclature lines both indicate that the additional copy number is associated with a supernumerary chromosome
            13, confirmed by the karyotype. Note: ISCN describes the chromosome abnormality and excludes a Robertsonian
            translocation while HGVS implies it is a gain of a supernumerary chromosome 13 but does not provide any addi-
            tional information.

      iv. seq[GRCh38] 18p11.32p11.21(158,684_14,853,925)×4

          or
          NC_000018.10:g.(pter_158684)_(14853925_?)[3]
            Sequencing shows four copies of the short arm of chromosome 18. No structural information is determined, and it
            is unknown if the additional copies of 18p are associated with an abnormal chromosome (e.g., supernumerary iso-
            chromosome 18p) or present in tandem. The ISCN microarray format is applied and either the short system or ab-
            breviated system can be used to describe the variant. The HGVS describes this finding as the detection of two ad-
            ditional copies [3] of chromosome 18 sequence located between positions 158,684 and 14,853,925. Note: dup or
            sup are not used in this circumstance because the nature of the abnormality is not known. Since ISCN and HGVS
            nomenclature indicate similar information, either can be used.

            or
            NC_000023.11:g.[pter_qter[2]];[pter_qter=]
            Sequencing shows three copies of the X chromosome using the abbreviated system (microarray format). There are
            no copies of the Y chromosome, suggesting that this individual’s sex chromosome complement is XXX. The HGVS
            nomenclature indicates that, compared to the reference sequence, there is one additional copy [2] of all X chromo-
            some sequences detected. The HGVS allele format used indicates that one normal copy of an X chromosome is also
            detected, giving a total of three X chromosomes. Note: sup is not used in this circumstance because the nature of the
            abnormality is not known. Since ISCN and HGVS nomenclature indicate similar information, either can be used.

            Chromosome analysis and sequencing data show three copies of the X chromosome, associated with a 47,XXX
            karyotype. HGVS nomenclature indicates that compared to the reference sequence, three X chromosome sequenc-
            es are detected, two normal (=) and one additional copy (sup). Since ISCN and HGVS nomenclature indicate sim-
            ilar information, either can be used.

      vii. seq (X)×2,(Y)×1

           [NC_000023.11:g.pter_qter[2]];[NC_000024.10:g.pter_qter=]
            Sequencing shows two copies of all X chromosome sequences, and one copy of all Y chromosome sequences. The
            copy number status of both the X and Y are explicitly given using the abbreviated system (microarray format) to
            clarify the sex chromosome complement of this individual. HGVS nomenclature indicates that, compared to the
            reference sequence, one additional copy [2] of all X chromosome sequences is detected with one copy of all Y
            chromosome sequences (NC_000024.10:g.pter_qter=). Since ISCN and HGVS nomenclature indicate similar in-
            formation, either can be used.

                    Sequencing shows one copy of all X chromosome sequences, and two copies of all Y chromosome sequences. The copy
                    number state of both X and Y are given using the abbreviated system (microarray format) to clarify the sex chromo-
                    some complement of this individual. HGVS nomenclature indicates that, compared to a reference sequence, a normal
                    copy of the X chromosome sequences is detected (NC_000023.11:g.pter_qter=) and an additional copy [2] of all Y
                    chromosome sequences is detected. Note: sup is not used in this circumstance because the nature of the Y chromosome
                    abnormality is not known. Since ISCN and HGVS nomenclature indicate similar information, either can be used.

                    Sequencing shows mosaicism for single copy loss of the X chromosome in 60% of the DNA sample, described us-
                    ing the abbreviated system (microarray format). The normal state is implied to be XX in this individual. HGVS
                    nomenclature indicates there is one X chromosome (=) present in the sample, with a mosaic loss of the second X
                    chromosome (=/del) in a proportion of the sample. The mosaicism percentage is not indicated in the HGVS nomen-
                    clature. Since the ISCN line is more informative this can be used in isolation without the HGVS nomenclature.
                    Note: the limitation of sequencing is that it cannot always differentiate between X/XX or X/XXX.



11.4.2        Large Structural and Copy Number Variation

11.4.2.1      Deletion

              i.    seq[GRCh38] del(10)(p15.3)dn
                    NC_000010.11:g.(pter)_2944337del
                    Sequencing shows an apparently terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 10. The ISCN short system
                    (karyotype format) describes a de novo terminal deletion with a breakpoint in 10p15.3. The short system (karyotype
                    format) is used to indicate that no additional structural variation is associated with this terminal deletion. The break-
                    points for the deletion are indicated in the HGVS line of the nomenclature. The deletion involves 10pter to nucleo-
                    tide 2,944,337. In this case, since the ISCN and HGVS nomenclature lines give different information, both should
                    be used to describe the variant.

              ii.   seq[GRCh38] 10p15.3(46,696_1,737,263)×1dn
                    or
                    NC_000010.11:g.(pter_46696)_(1737263_?)del
                    Sequencing shows an apparently terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 10. The ISCN short system
                    (microarray format) describes a de novo terminal deletion with a breakpoint in 10p15.3 using a relative copy num-
                    ber detection methodology (e.g., exome sequencing) where neither the precise breakpoint nor structural information
                    are determined. The deletion involves the region 46,696 to 1,737,263 and the uncertainty range is not specified.
                    Note: this deletion is likely terminal, but the nomenclature describes only the region of the chromosome that is as-
                    sayed for copy number, similar to microarray format nomenclature. The HGVS nomenclature indicates that the
                    deletion is likely terminal, with the use of pter for the 5′ breakpoint, and the use of a question mark (?) for the
                    undefined 3′ breakpoint. While ISCN and HGVS nomenclature indicate similar genomic information, only ISCN
                    conveys the inheritance information and is therefore recommended.

                    (microarray format) describes a de novo terminal deletion with a breakpoint in 10p15.3 using a relative copy num-

           Sequencing shows an interstitial deletion within the long arm of chromosome 22. The ISCN extended system (microar-

           Sequencing shows an interstitial deletion within the long arm of the X chromosome in an XX individual. The ISCN

           The use of the short system indicates that the deletion is interstitial and is not associated with any other structural
           rearrangements. The HGVS line indicates that the deletion includes the segment from nucleotide 89,555,676 to
           nucleotide 100,352,080, with nucleotides 89,555,675 to 100,352,081 now joined. Since the breakpoint and struc-

           Sequencing shows an interstitial deletion within the long arm of the X chromosome in an XX individual. The ISCN
           extended system (microarray format) describes a heterozygous interstitial deletion within the long arm of the X
           chromosome from band Xq21.31 to Xq22.1 where neither the precise breakpoint nor related structural information
           is determined. The minimal deletion includes the segment from nucleotide 91,435,563 to nucleotide 100,342,090.
           The extended system indicates the neighboring proximal and distal regions that show normal copy number (two
           copies). As the extended system indicates that the normal copy is two for the X chromosome, and the Y chromo-
           some is not present, this individual can be inferred to have two X chromosomes, one with a deletion. The HGVS
           nomenclature indicates that there is an interstitial deletion of the X chromosome with the 5′ breakpoints between
           88,754,300 and 91,435,563 and the 3′ breakpoints between 100,342,090 and 100,402,866. To indicate that a dele-

                    tion is within a single chromosome band, the ISCN cannot distinguish the orientation of the duplicated material.
                    The HGVS line indicates the 54.7 kb tandem duplication within chromosome 18 involves nucleotides 79,670,244
                    to 79,724,961. Note: in HGVS dup can only be used when the duplicated sequence is in the same orientation as

          however, the karyotype data show the nature of the extra copies of this region are associated with a dicentric supernumerary
          chromosome, composed of inverted copies of 15pter to 15q13.1. The region of four copies detected by sequencing includes
          the segment from nucleotide 22,572,598 to 28,318,712 in bands 15q11.2 to 15q13.1; however, the proximal breakpoint is

          mental duplication region between 28,318,712 and 28,724,458. The HGVS nomenclature line describes a supernumerary

          compared to the reference sequence, one is in a normal orientation, and one is in an inverted orientation. The use of sup

                    tion or orientation of the regions of copy number gain. The HGVS line describes, compared to the reference se-
                    quence, the detection of one additional copy [2] of the sequence from 91,448,700 to 91,465,000, two additional

11.4.2.3      Derivative Chromosome

              The following examples describe copy number alterations that are associated with structural rear-
              rangements. If multiple copy number alterations are detected without any structural information, the
              nomenclature can be written similar to the microarray format nomenclature, with the copy number
              alterations listed in chromosomal numerical order. For complex findings, including chromothripsis,
              chromoanasynthesis, or other complexities that would result in a prohibitive number of abnormali-
              ties to describe in one nomenclature line, the microarray format for complex findings may be used
              (see Section 8.2.7 for examples).

                    Sequencing shows an apparently terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 2 and an apparently terminal
                    gain of the short arm of chromosome 11 associated with an unbalanced translocation. The ISCN short system (karyo-
                    type format) describes the derivative chromosome 2 with breakpoints in 2p25.1 and 11p15.2. The breakpoints of
                    the translocation are described in the HGVS line of the nomenclature and occur at 2p25.1 (between nucleotides
                    8,247,756 and 8,247,757) and 11p15.2 (between nucleotides 15,825,272 and 15,825,273). The delins after the chro-
                    mosome 2 breakpoints indicates that, compared to the reference sequence, the terminal region from chromosome 2
                    (2pter to 2p25.1) is deleted and is replaced by the terminal segment of chromosome 11 (11pter to 11p15.2). The
                    HGVS line of the nomenclature does not explicitly state that this sequence from chromosome 11 is a gain, but the
                    gain is implied since there is no derivative 11 described. Since the ISCN and HGVS nomenclature lines give dif-
                    ferent information, both should be used to describe the variant.

                    tion methodology (e.g., exome sequencing), where the precise breakpoints nor structural information is determined.
                    The deletion involves the first assayed region on the short arm of chromosome 2 (45,440) to 7,044,179. The copy
                    number gain involves the first assayed region of the short arm of chromosome 11 (197,297) to 15,247,208. The
                    uncertainty region of both copy number changes are not indicated. Note: the deletion and gain are likely terminal,
                    but the nomenclature describes only the region of the chromosome that is assayed for copy number, similar to array
                    nomenclature. The HGVS line describes two variants: an apparently terminal deletion of chromosome 2 sequences,
                    and an additional copy of chromosome 11 sequences. Since no structural information is obtained from the sequenc-
                    ing data, the insertional location of the 11p sequences is unknown, and each copy number variant is described on a

           Sequencing shows gain of an interstitial region of the long arm of the X chromosome, which is inserted into the
           long arm of chromosome 4. The ISCN short system (karyotype format) describes a derivative chromosome 4, with
           an additional inverted copy of Xq21.31 to Xq22.1 inserted into 4q28.3. Sequence data indicates the site of the in-
           sertion in chromosome 4 is between 134,850,793 to 134,850,794. The duplicated X chromosome sequences have
           uncertain breakpoints, between 89,555,676 to 89,556,012 and 100,351,998 to 100,352,080. This duplicated region
           of the X chromosome is inserted in an inverted orientation relative to the X chromosome reference sequence. In the
           ISCN description the sex chromosome complement is indicated, as it may help to interpret the clinical significance

        Sequencing shows a complex rearrangement between chromosomes 6, 12, and 21 resulting in three derivative chro-
        mosomes. The ISCN detailed system (karyotype format) describes each derivative chromosome from pter to qter,
        with multiple breakpoints in 6q14.1, 6q23.2, 12p13.2, and 21q22.12. Sequencing reveals deletions at the breakpoints
        of each derivative chromosome, thus the use of the short system (karyotype format) is inappropriate. The HGVS
        description indicates that, compared to the reference sequence, there are deletions of 53 Mb on chromosome 6
        (nucleotides 78,952,474 to 132,514,526), 109 bp on chromosome 12 (nucleotides 11,878,386 to 11,878,494), and
        a copy number of 2.5 kb on chromosome 21 (nucleotides 35,039,585 to 35,042,089). The copy number alterations
        are indicated by the differences between the corresponding deleted regions (e.g., 78,952,474 to qter for the deleted
        region of chromosome 6) and inserted regions (e.g., 132,514,527 to qter for the inserted region of chromosome 6).
        Since the ISCN and HGVS nomenclature lines give different information, both should be used to describe the vari-
        ant.

        Sequencing shows a complex rearrangement between chromosomes 6 and 13. The ISCN short system (karyotype
        format) describes two derivative chromosomes. The derivative 6 involves a translocation between 6q14.3 and
        13q31.1. A single base pair (A) inserted at the breakpoint between nucleotide position 85,897,871 at 6q14.3 and
        position 80,659,609 at 13q31.1. The derivative 13 is more complicated with a translocation at 6q14.3, and with an
        inversion and deletion within the chromosome 6 sequence that are translocated to the derivative chromosome 13.
        The chromosome 6 sequences now located on the derivative 13 involve a 2.6 kb inversion within 6q14.3 (85,897,899
        to 85,900,540) and a 7.4 Mb deletion (86,488,292 to 93,909,932) of chromosome 6q14.3 to 6q16.1. In addition to
        the large chromosome 6 deletion, there is a 2 bp deletion of chromosome 13 sequences (80,659,607 to 80,659,608)
        and a 28 bp deletion (85,897,871 to 85,897,898) of chromosome 6 sequences at the breakpoints. Since the ISCN

        Sequencing data from a targeted assay (e.g. exome sequencing) show the presence of two copies of the X chromo-
        some and a non-centromeric fragment of the Y chromosome in a male. One of the X chromosomes has an appar-
        ently terminal deletion of the short arm involving the pseudoautosomal region and additional material from the
        X-specific region of Xp22.33 to Xp22.31. The insertional location of the fragment of the Y chromosome is not
        known and should not be assumed in the nomenclature. The ISCN short system (microarray format) describes copy
        number findings involving the X and Y chromosomes. One copy of the distal end of the short arm of the X chro-
        mosome from 276,356 to 6,383,977 is present, with two copies for the remainder of the X chromosome (7,050,341

                    Sequencing shows a pericentric inversion of chromosome 6. The combination of the ISCN detailed system (karyo-
                    type format) and of the HGVS nomenclature indicates the inversion involves 776,788 to 93,191,545 with a T to C
                    nucleotide substitution at the breakpoint (nucleotide 93,191,546). Since the ISCN and HGVS nomenclature lines
                    give different information, both should be used to describe the variant.

                       Sequencing shows a paracentric inversion within the short arm of chromosome 6. The combination of the ISCN
                       short system (karyotype format) and of the HGVS nomenclature describe a paracentric inversion in the short arm
                       of chromosome 6 (nucleotides 20,271,801 to 39,524,349) with a single nucleotide substitution at the breakpoint
                       (39,524,350 A to C). Since the ISCN and HGVS nomenclature lines give different information, both should be used

11.4.2.7         Translocation

                 Translocations that appear balanced karyotypically may show imbalances at the breakpoint(s) by
                 sequencing. The following examples show a combination of the ISCN karyotype format (short
                 system or detailed system) and of the HGVS nomenclature to describe the gross structural change
                 to chromosomes as the result of a translocation that is identified by sequencing.

                       Chromosome analysis and sequencing data show a translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 2 and 11.
                       The karyotype breakpoints, at bands 2p24 and 11p15, are further defined by sequencing to be bands 2p25.1 and
                       11p15.2. The translocation involves the joining of the chromosome 11 nucleotide 15,825,272 to the chromosome
                       2 nucleotide 8,247,757 on the derivative chromosome 2, and the joining of the chromosome 2 nucleotide 8,247,756
                       to the chromosome 11 nucleotide 15,825,273 on the derivative chromosome 11. Since the ISCN and HGVS no-
                       menclature lines give different information, both should be used to describe the variant.

                       Sequencing shows a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 2 and 11. The translocation involves the
                       joining of chromosome 11 nucleotide 108,111,987 to the chromosome 2 nucleotide 174,500,008 on the derivative
                       chromosome 2, and the joining of the chromosome 2 nucleotide 174,500,009 to the chromosome 11 nucleotide
                       108,111,981 on the derivative chromosome 11. There is a 5 bp deletion of chromosome 11 sequence as evident
                       from the nucleotide numbers given for the two chromosome 11 breakpoints (from 108,111,982 to 108,111,986).

                       Sequencing shows a translocation between the short arm of chromosome 12 and the long arm of chromosome 21.

                       chromosome 12 breakpoints (from 11,873,173 to 11,874,853), and a 600 bp deletion of chromosome 21 sequence
                       evident from the nucleotide numbers given for the two chromosome 21 breakpoints (from 34,953,108 to 34,953,707).

        short arm of the first chromosome 9 at nucleotide 26,393,001. The HGVS nomenclature uses the allele format to
        indicate that these findings are found in trans, indicating that both chromosome 9s are abnormal. Since the ISCN

               This chapter provides a nomenclature for the chromatid and chromosome aberrations that may be
               observed in, for example, constitutional chromosome breakage syndromes or following clastogenic
               exposure.
                   Since many aberrations of this kind are scored on unbanded material, recommendations are
               given first for non-banded preparations and then for banded preparations.


12.1           Chromatid Aberrations

12.1.1         Non-Banded Preparations

         a. A chromatid (cht) aberration involves only one chromatid in a chromosome at a given locus.
         b. A chromatid gap (chtg) is a non-staining region (achromatic lesion) of a single chromatid in which
            there is minimal misalignment of the chromatid.
         c. A chromatid break (chtb) is a discontinuity of a single chromatid in which there is a clear mis-
            alignment of one of the chromatids.
         d. A chromatid exchange (chte) is the result of two or more chromatid lesions and the subsequent
            rearrangement of chromatid material. Exchanges may be between chromatids of different chromo-
            somes (interchanges) or between or within chromatids of one chromosome (intrachanges).
         e. In the case of interchanges, it will generally be sufficient to indicate the configuration as:
            • triradial (tr) when there are three arms to the pattern,
            • quadriradial (qr) when there are four, or
            • multiradial (mr) when there are more than four arms to the pattern.
         f. The number of centromeres may be indicated within parentheses (1 cen, 2 cen, etc.).


         190                  Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224   ISCN 2024
                              DOI: 10.1159/000538512
         g. When necessary, exchanges may be classified in more detail:
            • Asymmetrical exchanges inevitably result in the formation of an acentric fragment, whereas sym-
                metrical exchanges do not. In asymmetrical exchanges, the incompleteness may be proximal
                when the broken ends nearest the centromere are not rejoined or distal when the ends farthest
                from the centromere are not rejoined.
            • In complete exchanges, all broken ends are rejoined, but this does not occur in incomplete ex-
                changes.
            • Intra-arm events include duplications, deletions, paracentric inversions, and isochromatid breaks
                showing sister reunion.
            • It should be noted that these terms are descriptive only and do not imply knowledge of the origin
                of the aberrations.
         h. Sister chromatid exchange, detectable only by special staining methods, results from the inter-
            change of homologous segments between two chromatids of one chromosome. The abbreviation sce
            can be used to describe this event.


12.1.2        Banded Preparations

              Some chromatid aberrations can be defined more precisely or can be recognized with certainty only
              in banded preparations.
         a.   There is a space between two abbreviations, but there is no space between the last abbreviation and
              the parentheses.
         b.   A chromatid deletion (cht del) is the absence of a banded sequence from only one of the two chro-
              matids of a single chromosome.
         c.   A chromatid inversion (cht inv) is the reversal of a banded sequence of only one of the two chro-
              matids of a single chromosome.
         d.   Both cht del and cht inv are subclasses of chromatid exchanges (chte).
         e.   Where it is desired to specify the location of a chromatid aberration, the appropriate abbreviation
              can be followed by the band designation.
              i. chtg(4)(q25)                Chromatid gap in chromosome 4 at band 4q25.
              ii. chtb(4)(q25)               Chromatid break in chromosome 4 at band 4q25.
              iii. chte(4;10)(q25;q22)       Chromatid exchange involving chromosomes 4 and 10 at bands 4q25
                                             and 10q22.
              iv. cht del(1)(q12q25)         Chromatid deletion in chromosome 1 with loss of the segment between
                                             bands 1q12 and 1q25.
              v.   cht inv(1)(q12q25)        Chromatid inversion in chromosome 1 with reversal of the segment be-
                                             tween bands 1q12 and 1q25.
              vi. sce(4)(q25q33)             Sister chromatid exchanges in chromosome 4 at bands 4q25 and 4q33.



12.2          Chromosome Aberrations

12.2.1        Non-Banded Preparations

         a. A chromosome (chr) aberration involves both chromatids of a single chromosome at the same lo-
            cus.
         b. A chromosome gap (chrg) is a non-staining region (achromatic lesion) at the same locus in both
            chromatids of a single chromosome in which there is minimal misalignment of the chromatids. The
            term chromosome gap is synonymous with isolocus gap and isochromatid gap.
         c. A chromosome break (chrb) is a discontinuity at the same locus in both chromatids of a single
            chromosome, giving rise to an acentric fragment and an abnormal monocentric chromosome. This


         Chromosome Breakage and                  Cytogenet Genome Res 2024;164(suppl 1):1–224               191
         Instability                              DOI: 10.1159/000538512
               fragment is therefore a particular type of acentric fragment (ace), and chrb should be used only
               when the morphology indicates that the fragment is the result of a single event. The term chromo-
               some break is synonymous with isolocus break and isochromatid break.
         d.    A chromosome exchange (chre) is the result of two or more chromosome lesions and the subse-
               quent relocation of both chromatids of a single chromosome to a new position on the same or on
               another chromosome. It may be symmetrical (e.g., reciprocal translocation) or asymmetrical (e.g.,
               dicentric formation).
         e.    A minute (min) is an acentric fragment smaller than the width of a single chromatid. It may be
               single or double. In the special situation, when double minutes are present clonally in tumor cells,
               the abbreviation dmin is used; see Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.12.
         f.    Pulverization (pvz) indicates a situation where a cell contains both chromatid and/or chromosome
               gaps and breaks that are not normally associated with exchanges and are present in such numbers
               that they cannot be enumerated. Occasionally, one or more chromosomes in a cell are pulverized
               while the remaining chromosomes are of normal morphology; e.g., pvz(1) is a pulverized chromo-
               some 1.
         g.    Premature chromosome condensation (pcc) occurs when an interphase nucleus is induced to en-
               ter mitosis prematurely. A pcc may involve a G1 or a G2 nucleus. The chromatin of S-phase nuclei
               undergoing pcc often appears to be pulverized.
         h.    The term premature centromere division (pcd) may be used to describe premature separation of
               centromeres in metaphase. The pcd may affect one or more chromosomes in a fraction of the cells.


12.2.2         Banded Preparations

         a. When banded preparations allow adequate identification of chromosome segments or chromosome
            aberrations, the nomenclature described in ISCN 2024 can be used. When not, the observations can
            be described in words.
         b. A marker chromosome (mar) is a structurally rearranged chromosome in which no part can be
            identified by chromosome banding methods (see Section 5.5.12).


12.3           Scoring of Aberrations

         a. The main types of aberrations scored are chtg, chtb, chte, chrg, chrb, ace, min, r, dic, tr, qr, der,
            and mar, and reports should, where possible, give the data under these headings. It is recognized,
            however, that aberrations are frequently grouped to give adequate numbers, e.g., for statistical anal-
            ysis. When this is done, it should be indicated how the groupings relate to the aberrations listed
            above, e.g.:
            • Chromatid aberrations:         chtg, chtb, chte
            • Fragments (= deletions): chrb, ace, min
            • Asymmetric aberrations: ace, dic, r
         b. The data should not be presented as deduced breakages per cell but in such a manner that it is pos-

             Chromosome bands reflect the functional organization of the genome that regulates DNA replica-
             tion, repair, transcription, and genetic recombination. The molecular basis of banding methods is
             known to involve nucleotide base composition, associated proteins, and genome functional organi-
             zation. In general, Giemsa-positive bands (G-dark bands, R-light bands) are AT-rich, late replicat-
             ing, and gene poor; whereas, Giemsa-negative bands (G-light bands, R-dark bands) are CG-rich,
             early replicating, and relatively gene rich. Note: if fluorescent R- or G-banding is used, then the dark
             and light bands may be different.
                  Centromeric DNA and pericentromeric heterochromatin, composed of α-repetitive DNA and
             various families of repetitive satellite DNA, are easily detected by C-banding. The telomere is com-
             posed of 5 to 20kb of tandem hexanucleotide minisatellite repeat units, TTAGGG, and stains dark-
             ly by T-banding. The 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes are clustered together in large arrays con-
             taining about 40 copies of each gene. These are located on the acrocentric short arms, at the nucleo-
             lar organizer regions or NORs, and are detected by silver staining.


15.2         Chromosome Banding

             The original banding pattern was described in the Paris Conference (1971) report and was based on
             the patterns observed in different metaphase cells stained with either the Q-, G-, or R-banding tech-
             nique (Fig. 14). The banding patterns obtained with these staining methods agreed sufficiently to
             allow the construction of a single idiogram representative of all three techniques. The bands were
             designated on the basis of their midpoints and not by their margins. Intensity was taken into consid-
             eration in determining which bands should serve as landmarks on each chromosome in order to di-
             vide the chromosome into natural, easily recognizable morphologic regions. A list of bands serving
             as landmarks that were used in constructing this diagram is provided in Table 12.

              The idiograms showing the G-banding patterns for normal human chromosomes at five differ-
          ent levels of resolution are shown in Figure 15. The corresponding G- and R-banded chromosomes
          are for approximately the same resolution in Figures 16a and 16b.

   The omission of an entire chromosome or chromosome arm indicates that either both arms or the arm in
   question consists of only one region, delimited by the centromere and the end of the chromosome arm.
